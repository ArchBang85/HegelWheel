<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 1<br />
The complete transformation which philosophical thought in Germany has undergone in the last twenty&minus;five&nbsp;years and the higher standpoint reached by spirit in its awareness of itself, have had but little influence as yet&nbsp;on the structure of logic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 2<br />
That which, prior to this period, was called metaphysics has been, so to speak, extirpated root and branch and&nbsp;has vanished from the ranks of the sciences. The ontology, rational psychology, cosmology, yes even natural&nbsp;theology, of former times&minus;where is now to be heard any mention of them, or who would venture to mention&nbsp;them? Inquiries, for instance, into the immateriality of the soul, into efficient and final causes, where should&nbsp;these still arouse any interest? Even the former proofs of the existence of God are cited only for their&nbsp;historical interest or for purposes of edification and uplifting the emotions. The fact is that there no longer&nbsp;exists any interest either in the form or the content of metaphysics or in both together. If it is remarkable&nbsp;when a nation has become indifferent to its constitutional theory, to its national sentiments, its ethical&nbsp;customs and virtues, it is certainly no less remarkable when a nation loses its metaphysics, when the spirit<br />
which contemplates its own pure essence is no longer a present reality in the life of the nation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 3<br />
The exoteric teaching of the Kantian philosophy &minus;&minus; that the understanding ought not to go beyond&nbsp;experience, else the cognitive faculty will become a theoretical reason which itself generates nothing but&nbsp;fantasies of the brain &minus;&minus; this was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation of&nbsp;speculative thought. In support of this popular teaching came the cry of modern educationists that the needs&nbsp;of the time demanded attention to immediate requirements, that just as experience was the primary factor for&nbsp;knowledge, so for skill in public and private life, practice and practical training generally were essential and&nbsp;alone necessary, theoretical insight being harmful even. Philosophy [Wissenschaft] and ordinary common&nbsp;sense thus co&minus;operating to bring about the downfall of metaphysics, there was seen the strange spectacle of a&nbsp;cultured nation without metaphysics&minus;like a temple richly ornamented in other respects but without a holy of&nbsp;holies. Theology, which in former times was the guardian of the speculative mysteries and of metaphysics&nbsp;(although this was subordinate to it) had given up this science in exchange for feelings, for what was&nbsp;popularly matter&minus;of&minus;fact, and for historical erudition. In keeping with this change, there vanished from the&nbsp;world those solitary souls who were sacrificed by their people and exiled from the world to the end that the&nbsp;eternal should be contemplated and served by lives devoted solely thereto &minus;&minus; not for any practical gain but&nbsp;for the sake of blessedness; a disappearance which, in another context, can be regarded as essentially the&nbsp;same phenomenon as that previously mentioned. So that having got rid of the dark utterances of metaphysics,&nbsp;of the colourless communion of the spirit with itself, outer existence seemed to be transformed into the bright&nbsp;world of flowers&minus;and there are no black flowers, as we know.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 4<br />
Logic did not fare quite so badly as metaphysics. That one learns from logic how to think (the usefulness of&nbsp;logic and hence its purpose, were held to consist in this &minus;&minus; just as if one could only learn how to digest and&nbsp;move about by studying anatomy and physiology) this prejudice has long since vanished, and the spirit of&nbsp;practicality certainly did not intend for logic a better fate than was suffered by the sister science.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 5<br />
Nevertheless, probably for the sake of a certain formal utility, it was still left a place among the sciences, and&nbsp;indeed was even retained as a subject of public instruction. However, this better lot concerns only the outer&nbsp;fate of logic, for its structure and contents have remained the same throughout a long inherited tradition,&nbsp;although in the course of being passed on the contents have become ever more diluted and attenuated; logic&nbsp;shows no traces so far of the new spirit which has arisen in the sciences no less than in the world of actuality.&nbsp;However, once the substantial form of the spirit has inwardly reconstituted itself, all attempts to preserve the&nbsp;forms of an earlier culture are utterly in vain; like withered leaves they are pushed off by the new buds&nbsp;already growing at their roots.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 6<br />
Even in the philosophical sphere this ignoring of the general change is beginning gradually to come to an end.&nbsp;Imperceptibly, even those who are opposed to the new ideas have become familiar with them and have&nbsp;appropriated them, and if they continue to speak slightingly of the source and principles of those ideas and to&nbsp;dispute them, still they have accepted their consequences and have been unable to defend themselves from&nbsp;their influence; the only way in which they can give a positive significance and a content to their negative&nbsp;attitude which is becoming less and less important, is to fall in with the new ways of thinking.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 7<br />
On the other hand, it seems that the period of fermentation with which a new creative idea begins is past. In&nbsp;its first manifestation, such an idea usually displays a fanatical hostility toward the entrenched&nbsp;systematisation of the older principle; usually too, it is fearful of losing itself in the ramifications of the&nbsp;particular and again it shuns the labour required for a scientific elaboration of the new principle and in its&nbsp;need for such, it grasps to begin with at an empty formalism. The challenge to elaborate and systematise the&nbsp;material now becomes all the more pressing. There is a period in the culture of an epoch as in the culture of&nbsp;the individual, when the primary concern is the acquisition and assertion of the principle in its undeveloped&nbsp;intensity. But the higher demand is that it should become systematised knowledge.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 8<br />
Now whatever may have been accomplished for the form and content of philosophy in other directions, the&nbsp;science of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy, has hitherto still been&nbsp;much neglected. What it is exactly that I understand by this science and its standpoint, I have stated&nbsp;provisionally in the Introduction.&nbsp;The fact that it has been necessary to make a completely fresh start with this science, the very nature of the&nbsp;subject matter and the absence of any previous works which might have been utilised for the projected&nbsp;reconstruction of logic, may be taken into account by fair&minus;minded critics, even though a labour covering&nbsp;many years has been unable to give this effort a greater perfection. The essential point of view is that what is&nbsp;involved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure.<br />
<br />
Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot, as I have remarked elsewhere, borrow its method from a&nbsp;subordinate science like mathematics, any more than it can remain satisfied with categorical assurances of&nbsp;inner intuition, or employ arguments based on grounds adduced by external reflection. On the contrary, it can&nbsp;be only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing,&nbsp;since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and generates its determinate&nbsp;character.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 9<br />
The understanding determines, and holds the determinations fixed; reason is negative and dialectical, because&nbsp;it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing; it is positive because it generates the&nbsp;universal and comprehends the particular therein.&nbsp;Just as the understanding is usually taken to be something separate from reason as such, so too dialectical&nbsp;reason is usually taken to be something distinct from positive reason. But reason in its truth is spirit which is&nbsp;higher than either merely positive reason, or merely intuitive understanding.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding; it negates&nbsp;what is simple, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thus&nbsp;dialectical.&nbsp;But it does not stay in the nothing of this result but in the result is no less positive, and in this way it has&nbsp;restored what was at first simple, but as a universal which is within itself concrete; a given particular is not&nbsp;subsumed under this universal but in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, the&nbsp;particular has at the same time already&nbsp;determined itself. This spiritual movement which, in its simple&nbsp;undifferentiatedness, gives itself its own determinateness and in its determinateness its equality with itself,&nbsp;which therefore is the immanent development of the Notion, this movement is the absolute method of&nbsp;knowing and at the same time is the immanent. soul of the content itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I maintain that it is this self&minus;construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective,<br />
demonstrated science.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 10<br />
It is in this way that I have tried to expound consciousness in the Phenomenology of Spirit. Consciousness is&nbsp;spirit as a concrete knowing, a knowing too, in which externality is involved; but the development of this&nbsp;object, like the development of all natural and spiritual life, rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities&nbsp;which constitute the content of logic.&nbsp;Consciousness, as spirit in its manifestation which in its progress frees itself from its immediacy and external&nbsp;concretion, attains to the pure knowing which takes as its object those same pure essentialities as they are in&nbsp;and for themselves. They are pure thoughts, spirit thinking its own essential nature. Their self&minus;movement is&nbsp;their spiritual life and is that through which philosophy constitutes itself and of which it is the exposition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 11<br />
In the foregoing there is indicated the relation of the science which I call the Phenomenology of Spirit, to&nbsp;logic. As regards the external relation, it was intended that the first part of the System of Science which&nbsp;contains the Phenomenology should be followed by a second part containing logic and the two concrete&nbsp;[realen] sciences, the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit, which would complete the System&nbsp;of Philosophy. But the necessary expansion which logic itself has demanded has induced me to have this part&nbsp;published separately; it thus forms the first sequel to the Phenomenology of Spirit in an expanded&nbsp;arrangement of the system. It will later be followed by an exposition of the two concrete philosophical&nbsp;sciences mentioned. This first volume of the Logic contains as Book One the Doctrine of Being; Book Two,&nbsp;the Doctrine of Essence, which forms the second part of the first volume, is already in the press; the second&nbsp;volume will contain Subjective Logic or the Doctrine of the Notion.<br />
<br />
&sect; 12<br />
When I undertook this fresh elaboration of the Science of Logic of which this is the first volume, I was fully&nbsp;conscious &minus;&minus; not only of the inherent difficulty of the subject matter and of its exposition, but also of the&nbsp;imperfection of its treatment in the first edition; earnestly as I have tried after many years of further&nbsp;occupation with this science to remedy this imperfection, I feel I still have reason enough to claim the&nbsp;indulgence of the reader. One title to such claim in the first instance may well be based on the fact that in the&nbsp;main there was available for the contents of the science only external material in the older metaphysics and&nbsp;logic. Though these two sciences have been universally and abundantly cultivated, the latter even up to our&nbsp;own day, the interest taken in the speculative side has been only slight; in fact, on the whole, the same&nbsp;material has been just repeated over and over again, sometimes being thinned out to the point of being trivial&nbsp;and superficial and sometimes more of the old ballast has been hauled out afresh and trailed along with logic.&nbsp;From such efforts, often purely mechanical, the philosophical import of the science could gain nothing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 13<br />
To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or what is the same, in&nbsp;its necessary development, had therefore to be a fresh undertaking, one that had to be started right from the&nbsp;beginning; but this traditional material, the familiar forms of thought, must be regarded as an extremely&nbsp;important source, indeed as a necessary condition and as a presupposition to be gratefully acknowledged even&nbsp;though what it offers is only here and there a meagre shred or a disordered heap of dead bones.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 14<br />
The forms of thought are, in the first instance, displayed and stored as human language. Nowadays we cannot&nbsp;be too often reminded that it is thinking which distinguishes man from the beasts. Into all that becomes&nbsp;something inward for men, an image or conception as such, into all that he makes his own, language has&nbsp;penetrated, and everything that he has transformed into language and expresses in it contains a&nbsp;category&minus;concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, so much is Logic his natural&nbsp;element, indeed his own peculiar nature. If nature as such, as the physical world, is contrasted with the&nbsp;spiritual sphere, then logic must certainly be said to be the supernatural element which permeates every&nbsp;relationship of man to nature, his sensation, intuition, desire, need, instinct, and simply by so doing&nbsp;transforms it into something human, even though only formally human, into ideas and purposes. It is an&nbsp;advantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions, that is, specific and separate&nbsp;expressions for the thought determinations themselves; many prepositions and articles denote relationships&nbsp;based on thought; the Chinese language is supposed not to have developed to this stage or only to an&nbsp;inadequate extent. These particles, however, play quite a subordinate part having only a slightly more&nbsp;independent form than the prefixes and suffixes, inflections and the like. It is much more important that in a&nbsp;language the categories should appear in the form of substantives and verbs and thus be stamped with the&nbsp;form of objectivity. In this respect German has many advantages over other modern languages; some of its&nbsp;words even possess the further peculiarity of having not only different but opposite meanings so that one&nbsp;cannot fail to recognise a speculative spirit of the language in them: it can delight a thinker to come across&nbsp;such words and to find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with opposite&nbsp;meanings, although this result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding. Philosophy&nbsp;therefore stands in no need of a special terminology; true, some words have to be taken from foreign&nbsp;languages but these have already acquired through usage the right of citizenship in the philosophical&nbsp;realm&minus;and an affected purism would be most inappropriate where it was the distinctive meaning which was&nbsp;of decisive importance. The advance of culture generally, and of the sciences in particular, gradually brings&nbsp;into use higher relationships of thought, or at least raises them to greater universality and they have thus&nbsp;attracted increased attention. This applies even to the empirical and natural sciences which in general employ&nbsp;the commonest categories, for example, whole and parts, a thing and its properties, and the like.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 15<br />
In physics, for example, the category of force has become predominant, but more recently the category of&nbsp;polarity which is the determination of a difference in which the different terms are inseparably conjoined, has&nbsp;played the leading part although it has been used inordinately in connection with all phenomena, even with&nbsp;light.&nbsp;It is a matter of infinite importance that in this way an advance has been made beyond the form of&nbsp;abstraction, of identity, by which a specific concept, as, for example, force, acquires an independent&nbsp;self&minus;subsistence, and that prominence and currency have been given to the determinate form, the difference,&nbsp;which is at the same time an inseparable element in the identity. Because of the fixed reality of natural&nbsp;objects the study of nature compels us to fix the categories which can no longer be ignored in her, although&nbsp;with complete inconsistency towards other categories which are also allowed to remain valid; and such study&nbsp;does not permit the further step of abstracting from the opposition and indulging in generalities as so easily&nbsp;happens in the intellectual sphere.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 16<br />
But while logical objects and their expressions may be thoroughly familiar to educated people it does not&nbsp;follow, as I have said elsewhere, that they are intelligently apprehended; and to have to occupy oneself with&nbsp;what is familiar can even arouse impatience &minus;&minus; and what is more familiar than just those determinations of&nbsp;thought which we employ on every occasion, which pass our lips in every sentence we speak?&nbsp;It is the purpose of this foreword to indicate the general features of the course followed by knowing in its&nbsp;advance beyond a mere acquaintance with its objects, of the relation of philosophical [wissenschaftlichen]&nbsp;thinking to this natural thinking. This much, together with what was contained in the earlier Introduction, will&nbsp;be sufficient to give a general idea of what is meant by logical cognition, the kind of preliminary general idea&nbsp;which is demanded in the case of any science prior to its exposition, that is, prior to the import of the science&nbsp;itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 17<br />
In the first place, we must regard it as an infinite step forward that the forms of thought have been freed from&nbsp;the material in which they are submerged in self&minus;conscious intuition, figurate conception, and in our desiring&nbsp;and willing, or rather in ideational desiring and willing &minus;&minus; and there is no human desiring or willing without&nbsp;ideation &minus;&minus; and that these universalities have been brought into prominence for their own sake and made&nbsp;objects of contemplation as was done by Plato and after him especially by Aristotle; this constitutes the&nbsp;beginning of the intelligent apprehension of them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&#39;It was only&#39;, says Aristotle, &#39;after almost everything necessary and everything requisite for human comfort&nbsp;and intercourse was available, that man began to concern himself with philosophical knowledge&#39; &#39;In Egypt&#39;,&nbsp;he had previously remarked, &#39;there was an early development of the mathematical sciences because there the&nbsp;priestly caste at an early stage were in a position to have leisure&#39;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 18<br />
As a matter of fact, the need to occupy oneself with pure thought presupposes that the human spirit must&nbsp;already have travelled a long road.&nbsp;In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself and communes only with itself, the interests which&nbsp;move the lives of races and individuals are hushed. it is, one may say, the need of the already satisfied need for the necessities to which it must have attained, the need of a condition free from needs, of abstraction from&nbsp;the material of intuition, imagination, and so on, of the concrete interests of desire, instinct, will, in which&nbsp;material the determinations of thought are veiled and hidden. In the silent regions of thought which has come&nbsp;to itself and communes only with itself, the interests which move the lives of races and individuals are&nbsp;hushed.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 19<br />
&#39;In so many respects&#39;, says Aristotle in the same context, &#39;the nature of man is in bondage; but this science,&nbsp;which is not studied for its utility, is the only absolutely free science and seems therefore to be a more than&nbsp;human possession.&#39; Philosophical thinking in general is still concerned with concrete objects &minus;&minus; God, nature,&nbsp;spirit; but logic is concerned only and solely with these thoughts as thoughts, in their complete abstraction.&nbsp;For this reason it is customary, to include logic in the curriculum of youth, for youth is not yet involved in the&nbsp;practical affairs of life, living at leisure so far as they are concerned; and it is only for its own subjective ends&nbsp;that it has to busy itself with acquiring the means to enable it to become actively engaged with the objects of&nbsp;those practical interests &minus;&minus; and still theoretically even with these. Contrary to Aristotle&#39;s view just mentioned,&nbsp;the science of logic is included in these means; the study of logic is a preliminary labour to be carried out in&nbsp;school and it is not until later that the serious business of life and the pursuit of substantial ends begins.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 20<br />
In life, the categories are used; from the honour of being contemplated for their own sakes they are degraded&nbsp;to the position where they serve in the creation and exchange of ideas involved in intellectual exercise on a&nbsp;living content. First they serve as abbreviations through their universality (for what a host of particulars of&nbsp;outer existence and actions is embraced by a conception &minus;&minus; battle, war, nation, ocean or animal, for example&nbsp;&minus;&minus; and in the conception of God or of love there is epitomised in the simplicity of such ideating an infinite&nbsp;host of ideas, actions, states, etc.!).&nbsp;Secondly, the categories serve for the more exact determination and discovery of objective relations; but in&nbsp;this process the import and purpose, the correctness and truth of the thought involved, are made to depend&nbsp;entirely on the subject matter itself and the thought determinations are not themselves credited with any&nbsp;active part in determining the content. Such a use of categories, which above was called natural logic, is&nbsp;unconscious; and when in philosophical reflection the categories are assigned the role of serving as means,&nbsp;then thinking as such is treated as something subordinate to the other activities of mind. We do not indeed say&nbsp;of our feelings, impulses or interests that they serve us, rather do they count as independent forces and&nbsp;powers, so that to have this particular feeling, to desire this, is what we are. But probably we are more&nbsp;conscious of obeying our feelings, impulses, passions, interests, not to mention habits, than of having them in&nbsp;our possession, still less, in view of our intimate union with them, of their being at our disposal. Such&nbsp;determinations of feeling and mind soon show themselves as particular in contrast to the universality which&nbsp;we are conscious ourselves of being and in which we have our freedom; and we are disposed to regard&nbsp;ourselves as caught up in these particular states and dominated by them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 21<br />
Consequently it is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas &minus;&minus;&nbsp;whether these are purely theoretical or contain a matter belonging to feeling, impulse, will &minus;&minus; are means for&nbsp;us, rather than that we serve them, that in fact they have us in their possession; what is there more in us as&nbsp;against them, how shall we, how shall I, set myself up as more universal than they, which are universal as&nbsp;such?&nbsp;When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree,&nbsp;the place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self&minus;certainty, of pure&nbsp;abstraction, of thought. Or again, to speak of things, we call the nature or the essence of things their notion,&nbsp;and this is only for thought; but still less shall we say of the notions of things that we dominate them, or that&nbsp;the determinations of thought of which they are the complex are at our service; on the contrary, it is our&nbsp;thinking that must accommodate itself to them and our caprice or freedom ought not to want to mould them&nbsp;to suit itself.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 22<br />
Since, therefore, subjective thought is our very own, innermost, act, and the objective notion of things&nbsp;constitutes their essential import, we cannot go outside this our act, we cannot stand above it, and just as little&nbsp;can we go beyond the nature of things. We can however disregard the latter determination; in so far as it&nbsp;coincides with the first it would yield a relation of our thoughts to the object, but this would be a valueless&nbsp;result because it would imply that the thing, the object, would be set up as a criterion for our notions and yet&nbsp;for us the object can be nothing else but our notions of it. The way in which the critical philosophy&nbsp;understands the relationship of these three terms is that we place our thoughts as a medium instead of&nbsp;connecting us with the objects rather cuts us off from them. But this view can be countered by the simple&nbsp;observation that these very things which are supposed to stand beyond us, and at the other extreme, beyond&nbsp;the thoughts referring to them, are themselves figments of subjective thought, and as wholly indeterminate&nbsp;they are only a single thought&minus;thing &minus;&minus; the so&minus;called thing&minus;in&minus;itself of empty abstraction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 23<br />
Still, sufficient has been said of the point of view which no longer takes the determinations of thought to be&nbsp;only an instrument and a means; more important is the further point connected with it, namely that it is usual&nbsp;to regard them as an external form. The activity of thought which is at work in all our ideas, purposes,&nbsp;interests and actions is, as we have said, unconsciously busy (natural logic); what we consciously attend to is&nbsp;the contents, the objects of our ideas, that in which we are interested; on this basis, the determinations of&nbsp;thought have the significance of forms which are only attached to the content, but are not the content itself.&nbsp;But if the truth of the matter is what we have already stated and also is generally admitted, namely that the&nbsp;nature, the peculiar essence, that which is genuinely permanent and substantial in the complexity and&nbsp;contingency of appearance and fleeting manifestation, is the notion of the thing, the immanent universal, and&nbsp;that each human being though infinitely unique is so primarily because he is a man, and each individual&nbsp;animal is such individual primarily because it is an animal: if this is true, then it would be impossible to say&nbsp;what such an individual could still be if this foundation were removed, no matter how richly endowed the&nbsp;individual might be with other predicates, if, that is, this foundation can equally be called a predicate like the&nbsp;others. The indispensable foundation, the notion, the universal which is the thought itself, in so far as one can&nbsp;make abstraction from the general idea expressed by the word &#39;thought&#39;, cannot be regarded as only an&nbsp;indifferent form attached to a content. But these thoughts of everything natural and spiritual, even the&nbsp;substantial content , still contain a variety of determinatenesses and are still charged with the difference of a&nbsp;soul and a body, of the notion and a relative reality; the profounder basis is the soul itself, the pure Notion&nbsp;which is the very heart of things, their simple life&minus;pulse, even of subjective thinking of them.&nbsp;To focus attention on this logical nature which animates mind, moves and works in it, this is the task. The&nbsp;broad distinction between the instinctive act and the intelligent and free act is that the latter is performed with&nbsp;an awareness of what is being done; when the content of the interest in which one is absorbed is drawn out of&nbsp;its immediate unity with oneself and becomes an independent object of one&#39;s thinking, then it is that spirit&nbsp;begins to be free, whereas when thinking is an instinctive activity, spirit is enmeshed in the bonds of its&nbsp;categories and is broken up into an infinitely varied material.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 24<br />
Here and there in this mesh there are firm knots which give stability and direction to the life and&nbsp;consciousness of spirit; these knots or nodes owe their fixity and power to the simple fact that having been&nbsp;brought before consciousness, they are independent, self&minus;existent Notions of its essential nature. The most&nbsp;important point for the nature of spirit is not only the relation of what it is in itself to what it is actually, but&nbsp;the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is; because spirit is essentially consciousness, this&nbsp;self&minus;knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 25<br />
As impulses the categories are only instinctively active. At first they enter consciousness separately and so&nbsp;are variable and mutually confusing; consequently they afford to mind only a fragmentary and uncertain&nbsp;actuality; the loftier business of logic therefore is to clarify these categories and in them to raise mind to&nbsp;freedom and truth.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we indicated as the beginning of the science [of logic] &minus;&minus; a beginning which we have already&nbsp;recognised as having a high value both on its own account and as a condition of genuine knowledge &minus;&minus;&nbsp;namely, the treatment of Notions generally and the moments of the Notion, that is, the determinations of&nbsp;thought, primarily as forms which are distinct from the matter of thought and only attached to it, this attitude&nbsp;directly reveals itself as intrinsically inadequate for the attainment of truth &minus;&minus; and the truth is the declared&nbsp;object of and aim of logic. For, as such mere forms, as distinct from the content, they are assumed to be&nbsp;standing in a determination which stamps them as finite and makes them incapable of holding the truth which&nbsp;is in its own self infinite. In whatever respect the true may be associated with limitation and finitude, this is&nbsp;the aspect of its negation, of its untruth and unreality, that is, of its end, not of the affirmation which, as the&nbsp;true, it is.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 27<br />
Faced with the baldness of the merely formal categories, the instinct of healthy common sense has, in the end,&nbsp;felt itself to be so much in the right that it has contemptuously abandoned acquaintanceship with them to the&nbsp;domain of school logic and metaphysics; at the same time, common sense fails to appreciate the value even of&nbsp;a proper awareness of these fragments and is quite unaware that in the instinctive thinking of natural logic,&nbsp;and still more in the deliberate rejection of any acquaintance with or knowledge of the thought determinations&nbsp;themselves, it is in bondage to unclarified and therefore unfree thinking. The simple basic determination or&nbsp;common form of the collection of such forms is identity which, in the logic of this collection, is asserted as&nbsp;the law of identity, as A = A, and as the principle of contradiction. Healthy common sense has so much lost&nbsp;its respect for the school which claims possession of such laws of truth and still busies itself with them that it&nbsp;ridicules it and its laws and regards anyone as insufferable who can utter truths in accordance with such laws:&nbsp;the plant is &minus;&minus; a plant, science is &minus;&minus; science. It has also formed an equally just estimate of the significance of&nbsp;the formulas which constitute the rules of syllogising which in fact is a cardinal function of the understanding&nbsp;(although it would be a mistake not to recognise that these have their place in cognition where they must be&nbsp;obeyed); it knows that the formulas quite as well serve impartially error and sophistry and that however truth&nbsp;may be defined, they cannot serve higher, for example, religious truth &minus;&minus; that generally speaking they&nbsp;concern only the correctness of the knowledge of facts, not truth itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 28<br />
The inadequacy of this way of regarding thought which leaves truth on one side can only be made good by&nbsp;including in our conception of thought not only that which is usually reckoned as belonging to the external&nbsp;form but the content as well. It is soon evident that what at first to ordinary reflection is, as content, divorced&nbsp;from form, cannot in fact be formless, cannot be devoid of inner determination; if it were, then it would be&nbsp;only vacuity, the abstraction of the thing&minus;in&minus;itself; that, on the contrary, the content in its own self possesses&nbsp;form, in fact it is through form alone that it has soul and meaning, and that it is form itself which is&nbsp;transformed only into the semblance of a content, hence into the semblance of something external to this&nbsp;semblance. With this introduction of the content into the logical treatment, the subject matter is not things but&nbsp;their import, the Notion of them. But in this connection we can be reminded that there is a multitude of&nbsp;Notions, a multitude of objects [Sache]. We have, however, already said how it is that restrictions are&nbsp;imposed on this multitude, that the Notion, simply as thought, as a universal, is the immeasurable&nbsp;abbreviation of the multitudes of particular things which are vaguely present to intuition and pictorial&nbsp;thought; but also a Notion is, first, in its own self the Notion, and this is only one and is the substantial&nbsp;foundation; secondly, a Notion is determinate and it is this determinateness in it which appears as content: but&nbsp;the determinateness of the Notion is a specific form of this substantial oneness, a moment of the form as&nbsp;totality, of that same Notion which is the foundation of the specific Notions.&nbsp;This Notion is not sensuously intuited or represented; it is solely an object, a product and content of thinking,&nbsp;and is the absolute, self&minus;subsistent object, the logos, the reason of that which is, the truth of what we call&nbsp;things; it is least of all the logos which should be left outside of the science of logic.&nbsp;Therefore its inclusion in or omission from this science must not be simply a matter of choice. When those&nbsp;determinations of thought which are only external forms are truly considered in themselves, this can only&nbsp;result in demonstrating their finitude and the untruth of their supposed independent self&minus;subsistence, that&nbsp;their truth is the Notion. Consequently, the science of logic in dealing with the thought determinations which&nbsp;in general run through our mind instinctively and unconsciously &minus;&minus; and even when they become part of the&nbsp;language do not become objects of our attention &minus;&minus; will also be a reconstruction of those which are singled&nbsp;out by reflection and are fixed by it as subjective forms external to the matter and import of the&nbsp;determinations of thought.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 29<br />
No subject matter is so absolutely capable of being expounded with a strict immanent plasticity as is thought&nbsp;in its own necessary development; no other brings with it this demand in such a degree; in this respect the&nbsp;Science of Logic must surpass even mathematics, for no subject matter has in its own self this freedom and&nbsp;independence. Such an exposition would demand that at no stage of the development should any&nbsp;thought&minus;determination or reflection occur which does not immediately emerge at this stage and that has not&nbsp;entered this stage from the one preceding it &minus;&minus; a requirement which is satisfied, after its fashion, in the&nbsp;process of mathematical reasoning. However, such an abstract perfection of exposition must, I admit, in&nbsp;general be dispensed with; the very fact that the science must begin with what is absolutely simple, that is,&nbsp;with what is most general and of least import, would restrict the exposition solely to these same quite simple&nbsp;expressions of the simple without any further addition of a single word; all that could properly be admitted&nbsp;would be negative considerations intended to ward off and banish any heterogeneous elements which&nbsp;otherwise might be introduced by pictorial thought or unregulated thinking. However, such intrusive&nbsp;elements in the simple immanent course of the development are themselves contingent, so that the effort to&nbsp;ward them off is itself tainted with this contingency; besides which it is futile to try to deal with all of them,&nbsp;lying as they do outside the subject matter, and in any case, any demand for a systematic disposal of such&nbsp;random reflections could only be partially satisfied. But the peculiar restlessness and distraction of our&nbsp;modern consciousness compel us to take some account of the more readily suggested reflections and&nbsp;opinions. A plastic discourse demands, too, a plastic receptivity and understanding on the part of the listener;&nbsp;but youths and men of such a temper who would calmly suppress their own reflections and opinions in which&nbsp;original thought is so impatient to manifest itself, listeners such as Plato feigned, who would attend only to&nbsp;the matter in hand, could have no place in a modern dialogue; still less could one count on readers of such a&nbsp;disposition. On the contrary, I have been only too often and too vehemently attacked by opponents who were&nbsp;incapable of making the simple reflection that their opinions and objections contain categories which are&nbsp;presuppositions and which themselves need to be criticised first before they are employed. Ignorance in this&nbsp;matter reaches incredible lengths; it is guilty of, the fundamental misunderstanding, the uncouth and&nbsp;uneducated behaviour of taking a category which is under consideration for something other than the&nbsp;category itself. This ignorance is the less justifiable because this &#39;something other&#39; consists of determinate&nbsp;thoughts and concepts, and in a system of logic these other categories must likewise have been assigned their&nbsp;own place and must themselves have been subjected to critical examination within the system. This ignorance&nbsp;is most obvious in the great majority of the objections and attacks on the first Notions of logic, being and&nbsp;nothing, and becoming which, itself a simple determination &minus;&minus; the simplest analysis shows it to be so &minus;&minus;&nbsp;contains the two other determinations as moments. Thoroughness seems to require that the beginning, as the&nbsp;foundation on which everything is built, should be examined before anything else, in fact that we should not&nbsp;go any further until it has been firmly established and if, on the other hand, it is not, that we should reject all&nbsp;that follows.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 30<br />
This thoroughness at the same time has the advantage of guaranteeing that the labour of thinking shall be&nbsp;reduced to a minimum; it has before it, enclosed in this germ, the entire development and reckons that it has&nbsp;settled the whole business when it has disposed of the beginning which is the easiest part of the business, for&nbsp;it is the simplest, the simple itself; it is the trifling effort of thought required to do this which really&nbsp;recommends this &#39;thoroughness&#39; which is so satisfied with itself.&nbsp;This restriction to what is simple gives scope for the free play of caprice which does not want to remain&nbsp;simple but brings in its own reflections on the subject matter. Having good right to occupy itself at first only&nbsp;with the principle and in doing so not to concern itself with what lies beyond it, this thoroughness actually&nbsp;proceeds to do the opposite of this, for it does bring in what lies beyond, that is, categories other than those&nbsp;which constitute the principle itself, other presuppositions and prejudices. Such presuppositions as that&nbsp;infinite is different from finitude, that content is other than form, that the inner is other than the outer, also&nbsp;that mediation is no immediacy (as if anyone did not know such things), are brought forward by way of&nbsp;information and narrated and asserted rather than proved. But there is something stupid &minus;&minus; I can find no other&nbsp;word for it &minus;&minus; about this didactic behaviour; technically it is unjustifiable simply to presuppose and&nbsp;straightway assume such propositions; and, still more, it reveals ignorance of the fact that it is the&nbsp;requirement and the business of logical thinking to enquire into just this, whether such a finite without&nbsp;infinity is something true, or whether such an abstract infinity, also a content without form and a form&nbsp;without content, an inner by itself which has no outer expression, an externality without an inwardness,&nbsp;whether any of these is something true or something actual. But this education and discipline of thinking by&nbsp;which it acquires plasticity and by which the impatience of casual reflection is overcome, is procured solely&nbsp;by going further, by study and by carrying out to its conclusion the entire development.</span></p>

Anyone who labours at presenting anew an independent structure of philosophical science may, when&nbsp;referring to the Platonic exposition, be reminded of the story that Plato revised his Republic seven times over.&nbsp;The remembrance of this, the comparison, so far as such may seem to be implied in it, should only urge one&nbsp;all the more to wish that for a work which, as belonging to the modern world, is confronted by a profounder&nbsp;principle, a more difficult subject matter and a material richer in compass, leisure had been afforded to revise&nbsp;it seven and seventy times.</span></p>

However, the author, in face of the magnitude of the task, has had to content himself with what it was&nbsp;possible to achieve in circumstances of external necessity, of the inevitable distractions caused by the&nbsp;magnitude and many&minus;sidedness of contemporary affairs, even under the doubt whether the noisy clamour of&nbsp;current affairs and the deafening chatter of a conceit which prides itself on confining itself to such matters&nbsp;leave any room for participation in the passionless calm of a knowledge which is in the element of pure&nbsp;thought alone.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><strong>Introduction. General Notion of Logic</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 33<br />
In no science is the need to begin with the subject matter itself, without preliminary reflections, felt more<br />
strongly than in the science of logic. In every other science the subject matter and the scientific method are<br />
distinguished from each other; also the content does not make an absolute beginning but is dependent on<br />
other concepts and is connected on all sides with other material. These other sciences are, therefore, permitted<br />
to speak of their ground and its context and also of their method, only as premises taken for granted which, as<br />
forms of definitions and such&minus;like presupposed as familiar and accepted, are to be applied straight&minus;way, and<br />
also to employ the usual kind of reasoning for the establishment of their general concepts and fundamental<br />
determinations.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 34<br />
Logic on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection and laws of thinking, for these<br />
constitute part of its own content and have first to be established within the science. But not only the account<br />
of scientific method, but even the Notion itself of the science as such belongs to its content, and in fact<br />
constitutes its final result; what logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather does this knowledge of what it is<br />
first emerge as the final outcome and consummation of the whole exposition. Similarly, it is essentially<br />
within the science that the subject matter of logic, namely, thinking or more specifically comprehensive<br />
thinking is considered; the Notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore be<br />
premised. Consequently, what is premised in this Introduction is not intended, as it were, to establish the<br />
Notion of Logic or to justify its method scientifically in advance, but rather by the aid of some reasoned and<br />
historical explanations and reflections to make more accessible to ordinary thinking the point of view from<br />
which this science is to be considered.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 35<br />
When logic is taken as the science of thinking in general, it is understood that this thinking constitutes the<br />
mere form of a cognition that logic abstracts from all content and that the so&minus;called second constituent<br />
belonging to cognition, namely its matter, must come from somewhere else; and that since this matter is<br />
&nbsp;Science of Logic<br />
Introduction. General Notion of Logic 12<br />
absolutely independent of logic, this latter can provide only the formal conditions of genuine cognition and<br />
cannot in its own self contain any real truth, not even be the pathway to real truth because just that which is<br />
essential in truth, its content, lies outside logic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 36<br />
But in the first place, it is quite inept to say that logic abstracts from all content, that it teaches only the rules<br />
of thinking without any reference to what is thought or without being able to consider its nature. For as<br />
thinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be the subject matter of logic, these directly constitute its<br />
peculiar content; in them, logic has that second constituent, a matter, about the nature of which it is<br />
concerned.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 37<br />
But secondly, the conceptions on which the Notion of logic has rested hitherto have in part already been<br />
discarded, and for the rest, it is time that they disappeared entirely and that this science were grasped from a<br />
higher standpoint and received a completely changed shape.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 38<br />
Hitherto, the Notion of logic has rested on the separation, presupposed once and for all in the ordinary<br />
consciousness, of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty. First, it is assumed that the<br />
material of knowing is present on its own account as a ready&minus;made world apart from thought, that thinking<br />
on its own is empty and comes as an external form to the said material, fills itself with it and only thus<br />
acquires a content and so becomes real knowing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 39<br />
Further, these two constituents &minus;&minus; for they are supposed to be related to each other as constituents, and<br />
cognition is compounded from them in a mechanical or at best chemical fashion &minus;&minus; are appraised as follows:<br />
the object is regarded as something complete and finished on its own account, something which can entirely<br />
dispense with thought for its actuality, while thought on the other hand is regarded as defective because it has<br />
to complete itself with a material and moreover, as a pliable indeterminate form, has to adapt itself to its<br />
material. Truth is the agreement of thought with the object, and in order to bring about this agreement &minus;&minus; for<br />
it does not exist on its own account &minus;&minus; thinking is supposed to adapt and accommodate itself to the object.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 40<br />
Thirdly, when the difference of matter and form, of object and thought is not left in that nebulous<br />
indeterminateness but is taken more definitely, then each is regarded as a sphere divorced from the other.<br />
Thinking therefore in its reception and formation of material does not go outside itself; its reception of the<br />
material and the conforming of itself to it remains a modification of its own self, it does not result in thought<br />
becoming the other of itself; and self&minus;conscious determining moreover belongs only to thinking. In its<br />
relation to the object, therefore, thinking does not go out of itself to the object; this, as a thing&minus;in&minus;itself,<br />
remains a sheer beyond of thought.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 41<br />
These views on the relation of subject and object to each other express the determinations which constitute<br />
the nature of our ordinary, phenomenal consciousness; but when these prejudices are carried out into the<br />
sphere of reason as if the same relation obtained there, as if this relation were something true in its own self,<br />
then they are errors the &minus;&minus; refutation of which throughout every part of the spiritual and natural universe is<br />
philosophy, or rather, as they bar the entrance to philosophy, must be discarded at its portals.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 42<br />
Ancient metaphysics had in this respect a higher conception of thinking than is current today. For it based<br />
itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them,<br />
that is, things not in their immediacy but as first raised into the form of thought, as things thought. Thus this<br />
metaphysics believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its<br />
essential nature, or that things and the thinking of them &minus;&minus; our language too expresses their kinship &minus;&minus; are<br />
explicitly in full agreement, thinking in its immanent determinations and the true nature of things forming<br />
one and the same content.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 43<br />
But reflective understanding took possession of philosophy. We must know exactly what is meant by this<br />
expression which moreover is often used as a slogan; in general it stands for the understanding as abstracting,<br />
and hence as separating and remaining fixed in its separations. Directed against reason, it behaves as ordinary<br />
common sense and imposes its view that truth rests on sensuous reality, that thoughts are only thoughts,<br />
meaning that it is sense perception which first gives them filling and reality and that reason left to its own<br />
resources engenders only figments of the brain. In this self&minus;renunciation on the part of reason, the Notion of<br />
truth is lost; it is limited to knowing only subjective truth, only phenomena, appearances, only something to<br />
which the nature of the object itself does not correspond: knowing has lapsed into opinion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 44<br />
However, this turn taken by cognition, which appears as a loss and a retrograde step, is based on something<br />
more profound on which rests the elevation of reason into the loftier spirit of modern philosophy. The basis<br />
of that universally held conception is, namely, to be sought in the insight into the necessary conflict of the<br />
determinations of the understanding with themselves. The reflection already referred to is this, to transcend<br />
the concrete immediate object and to determine it and separate it. But equally it must transcend these its<br />
separating determinations and straightway connect them. It is at the stage of this connecting of the<br />
determinations that their conflict emerges. This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reason<br />
and the rising above those determinations which attains to an insight into their conflict is the great negative<br />
step towards the true Notion of reason. But the insight, when not thorough&minus;going, commits the mistake of<br />
thinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself; it does not recognise that the contradiction is<br />
precisely the rising of reason above the limitations of the understanding and the resolving of them, Cognition,<br />
instead of taking from this stage the final step into the heights, has fled from the unsatisfactoriness of the<br />
categories of the understanding to sensuous existence, imagining that in this it possesses what is solid and<br />
self&minus;consistent. But on the other hand, since this knowledge is self&minus;confessedly knowledge only of<br />
appearances, the unsatisfactoriness of the latter is admitted, but at the same time presupposed: as much as to<br />
say that admittedly, we have no proper knowledge of things&minus;in&minus;themselves but we do have a proper<br />
knowledge of them within the sphere of appearances, as if, so to speak, only the kind of objects were<br />
different, and one kind, namely things&minus;in&minus;themselves, did not fall within the scope of our knowledge but the<br />
other kind, phenomena, did. This is like attributing to someone a correct perception, with the rider that<br />
nevertheless he is incapable of perceiving what is true but only what is false. Absurd as this would be, it<br />
would not be more so than a true knowledge which did not know the object as it is in itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 45<br />
The criticism of the forms of the understanding has had the result already mentioned, that these forms do not<br />
apply to things&minus;in&minus;themselves. This can have no other meaning than that these forms are in themselves<br />
something untrue. But then if they are allowed to remain valid for subjective reason and experience, the<br />
criticism has not produced any alteration in them: they are left in the same shape for the subject knower as<br />
they formerly possessed for the object. If, however, they are inadequate for the thing&minus;in&minus;itself, still less must<br />
the understanding to which they are supposed to belong put up with them and rest content with them. If they<br />
cannot be determinations of the thing&minus;in&minus;itself, still less can they be determinations of the understanding to<br />
which one ought at least to concede the dignity of a thing&minus;in&minus;itself. The determinations of finite and infinite<br />
conflict in the same way, whether they are applied to time and space, to the world, or are determinations<br />
within the mind &minus;&minus; just as black and white produce grey whether they are mixed on a canvas or on the<br />
palette. If our conception of the world is dissolved by the transference to it of the determinations of infinite<br />
and finite, still more is spirit itself, which contains both of them, inwardly self&minus;contradictory and<br />
self&minus;dissolving: it is not the nature of the material or the object to which they are applied or in which they<br />
occur that can make a difference for it is only through those determinations and in accordance with them that<br />
the object contains the contradiction.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 46<br />
The forms of objective thinking, therefore, have been removed by this criticism only from the thing; but they<br />
have been left in the subject just as they were originally. That is to say, this criticism did not consider these<br />
forms on their own merits and according to their own peculiar content, but simply took them as accepted<br />
starting points from subjective logic: so that there was no question of an immanent deduction of them as<br />
forms of subjective logic, still less of a dialectical consideration of them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 47<br />
Transcendental idealism in its more consistent development, recognised the nothingness of the spectral<br />
thing&minus;in&minus;itself left over by the Kantian philosophy, this abstract shadow divorced from all content, and<br />
intended to destroy it completely. This philosophy also made a start at letting reason itself exhibit its own<br />
determinations. But this attempt, because it proceeded from a subjective standpoint, could not be brought to a<br />
successful conclusion. Later this standpoint, and with it too the attempt to develop the content of pure<br />
science, was abandoned.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 48<br />
But what is commonly understood by logic is considered without any reference whatever to metaphysical<br />
significance. This science in its present state has, it must be admitted, no content of a kind which the ordinary<br />
consciousness would regard as a reality and as a genuine subject matter. But it is not for this reason a formal<br />
science lacking significant truth. Moreover, the region of truth is not to be sought in that matter which is<br />
missing in logic, a deficiency to which the unsatisfactoriness of the science is usually attributed. The truth is<br />
rather that the insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered<br />
and dealt with. When they are taken as fixed determinations and consequently in their separation from each<br />
other and not as held together in an organic unity, then they are dead forms and the spirit which is their living,<br />
concrete unity does not dwell in them. As thus taken, they lack a substantial content &minus;&minus; a matter which would<br />
be substantial in itself. The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid<br />
foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations; and such a substantial being for them is usually<br />
sought outside them.<br />
But logical reason itself is the substantial or real being which holds together within itself every abstract<br />
determination and is their substantial, absolutely concrete unity. One need not therefore look far for what is<br />
commonly called a matter; if logic is supposed to lack a substantial content, then the fault does not lie with its<br />

subject matter but solely with the way in which this subject matter is grasped.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 49<br />
This reflection leads up to the statement of the point of view from which logic is to be considered, how it<br />
differs from previous modes of treatment of this science which in future must always be based on this, the<br />
only true standpoint.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 50<br />
In the Phenomenology of Mind, I have exhibited consciousness in its movement onwards from the first<br />
immediate opposition of itself and the object to absolute knowing. The path of this movement goes through<br />
every form of the relation of consciousness to the object and has the Notion of science of its result.<br />
This Notion therefore (apart from the fact that it emerges within logic itself) needs no justification here<br />
because it has received it in that work; and it cannot be justified in any other way than by this emergence in<br />
consciousness, all the forms of which are resolved into this Notion as into their truth. To establish or explain<br />
the Notion of science ratiocinatively can at most achieve this, that a general idea of the Notion is presented to<br />
our thinking and a historical knowledge of it is produced; but a definition of science &minus;&minus; or more precisely of<br />
logic &minus;&minus; has its proof solely in the already mentioned necessity of its emergence in consciousness. The<br />
definition with which any science makes an absolute beginning. cannot contain anything other than the<br />
precise and correct expression of what is imagined to be the accepted and familiar subject matter and aim of<br />
the science. That precisely this is what is imagined is an historical asseveration in respect of which one can<br />
only appeal to such and such as recognised facts; or rather the plea can be advanced that such and such could<br />
be accepted as recognised facts. There will always be someone who will adduce a case, an instance,<br />
according to which something more and different is to be understood by certain terms the definition of which<br />
must therefore be made more precise or more general and the science too, must be accommodated thereto.<br />
This again involves argumentation about what should be admitted or excluded and within what limits and to<br />
what extent; but argumentation is open to the most manifold and various opinions, on which a decision can<br />
finally be determined only arbitrarily. In this method of beginning a science with its definition, no mention is<br />
made of the need to demonstrate the necessity of its subject matter and therefore of the science itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 51<br />
The Notion of pure science and its deduction is therefore presupposed in the present work in so far as the<br />
Phenomenology of Spirit is nothing other than the deduction of it. Absolute knowing is the truth of every<br />
mode of consciousness because, as the course of the Phenomenology showed, it is only in absolute knowing<br />
that separation of the object from the certainty of itself is completely eliminated: truth is now equated with<br />
certainty and this certainty with truth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 52<br />
Thus pure science presupposes liberation from the opposition of consciousness. It contains thought in so far<br />
as this is just as much the object in its own self, or the object in its own self in so far as it is equally pure<br />
thought. As science, truth is pure self&minus;consciousness in its self&minus;development and has the shape of the self, so<br />
that the absolute truth of being is the known Notion and the Notion as such is the absolute truth of being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 53<br />
This objective thinking then, is the content of pure science. Consequently, far from it being formal, far from it<br />
standing in need of a matter to constitute an actual and true cognition, it is its content alone which has&nbsp;absolute truth, or, if one still wanted to employ the word matter, it is the veritable matter &minus;&minus; but a matter<br />
which is not external to the form, since this matter is rather pure thought and hance the absolute form itself.<br />
Accordingly, logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the realm of pure thought. This realm<br />
is truth as it is without veil and in its own absolute nature. It can therefore be said that this content is the<br />
exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and a finite mind.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 54<br />
Anaxagoras is praised as the man who first declared that Nous, thought, is the principle of the world, that the<br />
essence of the world is to be defined as thought. In so doing he laid the foundation for an intellectual view of<br />
the universe, the pure form of which must be logic.<br />
What we are dealing with in logic is not a thinking about something which exists independently as a base for<br />
our thinking and apart from it, nor forms which are supposed to provide mere signs or distinguishing marks<br />
of truth; on the contrary, the necessary forms and self&minus;consciousness of thought are the content and the<br />
ultimate truth itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 55<br />
To get some idea of this one must discard the prejudice that truth must be something tangible. Such<br />
tangibility is, for example, imported even into the Platonic Ideas which are in God&#39;s thinking, as if they are,<br />
as it were, existing things but in another world or region; while the world of actuality exists outside that<br />
region and has a substantial existence distinct from those Ideas and only through this distinction is a<br />
substantial reality. The Platonic Idea is the universal, or more definitely the Notion of an object; only in its<br />
Notion does something possess actuality and to the extent that it is distinct from its Notion it ceases to be<br />
actual and is a non&minus;entity; the side of tangibility and sensuous self&minus;externality belongs to this null aspect. But<br />
on the other side, one can appeal to the conceptions of ordinary logic itself; for it is assumed, for example,<br />
that the determinations contained in definitions do not belong only to the knower, but are determinations of<br />
the object, constituting its innermost essence and its very own nature. Or, if from given determinations others<br />
are inferred, it is assumed that what is inferred is not something external and alien to the object, but rather<br />
that it belongs to the object itself, that to the thought there is a correspondent being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 56<br />
It is implied generally in the use of forms of the Notion, of judgement, syllogism, definition, division, etc.,<br />
that they are not merely forms of self&minus;conscious thinking but also of the objective understanding.<br />
Thought is an expression which attributes the determination contained therein primarily to consciousness. But<br />
inasmuch as it is said that understanding, reason, is in the objective world, that mind and nature have<br />
universal laws to which their life and changes conform, then it is conceded that the determinations of thought<br />
equally have objective value and existence.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 57<br />
The critical philosophy had, it is true, already turned metaphysics into logic but it, like the later idealism, as<br />
previously remarked, was overawed by the object, and so the logical determinations were given an essentially<br />
subjective significance with the result that these philosophies remained burdened with the object they had<br />
avoided and were left with the residue of a thing&minus;in&minus;itself, an infinite obstacle, as a beyond. But the<br />
liberation from the opposition of consciousness which the science of logic must be able to presuppose lifts<br />
the determinations of thought above this timid, incomplete standpoint and demands that they be considered<br />
not with any such limitation and reference but as they are in their own proper character, as logic, as pure&nbsp;reason.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 58<br />
Kant moreover considers logic, that is, the aggregate of definitions and propositions which ordinarily passes<br />
for logic, to be fortunate in having attained so early to completion before the other sciences; since Aristotle, it<br />
has not lost any ground, but neither has it gained any, the latter because to all appearances it seems to be<br />
finished and complete. Now if logic has not undergone any change since Aristotle &minus;&minus; and in fact, judging by<br />
modern compendiums of logic the changes frequently consist mainly in omissions &minus;&minus; then surely the<br />
conclusion which should be drawn is that it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; for spirit, after its<br />
labours over two thousand years, must have attained to a higher consciousness about its thinking and about its<br />
own pure, essential nature.<br />
A comparison of the forms to which spirit has raised itself in the practical and religious sphere and in every<br />
branch of science both physical and mental, with the form presented by logic which is spirit&#39;s consciousness<br />
of its own pure essence, reveals so vast a difference that the utter inadequacy and unworthiness of the latter<br />
consciousness in comparison with the higher consciousness displayed in those other spheres cannot fail to<br />
strike the most superficial observer.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 59<br />
In point of fact the need for a reconstruction of logic has long since been felt. In form and in content, logic, as<br />
exhibited in the text&minus;books, may be said to have fallen into contempt. It is still dragged in, but more from a<br />
feeling that one cannot dispense with logic altogether and because the tradition of its importance still<br />
survives, rather than from a conviction that such commonplace content and occupation with such empty<br />
forms is valuable and useful.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 60<br />
The additions of psychological, pedagogic and even physiological material which logic received in the past<br />
have subsequently been recognised almost universally as disfigurements. A great part of these psychological,<br />
pedagogic and physiological observations, laws and rules, whether they occur in logic or anywhere else, must<br />
appear very shallow and trivial in themselves; and without exception all those rules such as, for example, that<br />
one must think out and test what one reads in books or hears by word of mouth, that when one&#39;s sight is not<br />
good one should help one&#39;s eyes by wearing spectacles &minus;&minus; rules which in textbooks of so&minus;called applied logic<br />
were solemnly set out in paragraphs and put forward as aids to the attainment of truth &minus;&minus; these must strike<br />
everyone as superfluous &minus;&minus; except only the writer or teacher who finds difficulty in expanding by some<br />
means or other the otherwise scanty and life&minus;less content of logic.&#39;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 61<br />
Regarding this content, the reason why logic is so dull and spiritless has already been given above. Its<br />
determinations are accepted in their unmoved fixity and are brought only into external relation with each<br />
other. In judgments and syllogisms the operations are in the main reduced to and founded on the quantitative<br />
aspect of the determinations; consequently everything rests on an external difference, on mere comparison<br />
and becomes a completely analytical procedure and mechanical calculation. The deduction of the so&minus;called<br />
rules and laws, chiefly of inference, is not much better than a manipulation of rods of unequal length in order<br />
to sort and group them according to size &minus;&minus; than a childish game of fitting together the pieces of a coloured<br />
picture puzzle.<br />
Consequently, this thinking has been equated, not incorrectly, with reckoning, and reckoning again with this<br />
thinking. In arithmetic, numbers are regarded as devoid of any concrete conceptual content, so apart from<br />
their wholly external relationship they have no meaning, and neither in themselves nor in their<br />
interrelationships are thoughts. When it is calculated in mechanical fashion that three&minus;fourths multiplied by<br />
two&minus;thirds makes one&minus;half, this operation contains about as much and as little thought as calculating whether<br />
in a logical figure this or that kind of syllogism is valid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 62<br />
Before these dead bones of logic can be quickened by spirit, and so become possessed of a substantial,<br />
significant content, its method must be that which alone can enable it to be pure science. In the present state<br />
of logic one can scarcely recognise even a trace of scientific method. It has roughly the form of an empirical<br />
science. The empirical sciences have found for their own appropriate purposes their own peculiar method,<br />
such as it is, of defining and classifying their material. Pure mathematics, too, has its method which is<br />
appropriate for its abstract objects and for the quantitative form in which alone it considers them. I have said<br />
what is essential in the preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit about this method and, in general, the<br />
subordinate form of scientific method which can be employed in mathematics; but it will also be considered<br />
in more detail in the logic itself. Spinoza, Wolff and others have let themselves be misled in applying it also<br />
to philosophy and in making the external course followed by Notion&minus;less quantity, the course of the Notion,<br />
a procedure which is absolutely contradictory.<br />
Hitherto philosophy had not found its method; it regarded with envy the systematic structure of mathematics,<br />
and, as we have said, borrowed it or had recourse to the method of sciences which are only amalgams of<br />
given material, empirical propositions and thoughts &minus;&minus; or even resorted to crude rejection of all method.<br />
However, the exposition of what alone can be the true method of philosophical science falls within the<br />
treatment of logic itself; for the method is the consciousness of the form of the inner self&minus;movement of the<br />
content of logic. .<br />
In the Phenomenology of Mind I have expounded an example of this method in application to a more<br />
concrete object, namely to consciousness. Here we are dealing with forms of consciousness each of which in<br />
realising itself at the same time resolves itself, has for its result its own negation &minus;&minus; and so passes into a<br />
higher form . All that is necessary to achieve scientific progress &minus;&minus; and it is essential to strive to gain this<br />
quite simple insight &minus;&minus; is the recognition of the logical principle that the negative is just as much positive, or<br />
that what is self&minus;contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially<br />
only into the negation of its particular content, in other words, that such a negation is not all and every<br />
negation but the negation of a specific subject matter which resolves itself, and consequently is a specific<br />
negation, and therefore the result essentially contains that from which it results; which strictly speaking is a<br />
tautology, for otherwise it would be an immediacy, not a result. Because the result, the negation, is a specific<br />
negation, it has content. It is a fresh Notion but higher and richer than its predecessor; for it is richer by the<br />
negation or opposite of the latter, therefore contains it, but also something more, and is the unity of itself and<br />
its opposite. It is in this way that the system of Notions as such has to be formed &minus;&minus; and has to complete itself<br />
in a purely continuous course in which nothing extraneous is introduced.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 63<br />
I could not pretend that the method which I follow in this system of logic &minus;&minus; or rather which this system in its<br />
own self follows &minus;&minus; is not capable of greater completeness, of much elaboration in detail; but at the same<br />
time I know that it is the only true method. This is self&minus;evident simply from the fact that it is not something<br />
distinct from its object and content; for it is the inwardness of the content, the dialectic which it possesses<br />
within itself, which is the mainspring of its advance. It is clear that no expositions can be accepted as<br />
scientifically valid which do not pursue the course of this method and do not conform to its simple rhythm,<br />
for this is the course of the subject matter itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 64<br />
In conformity with this method, I would point out that the divisions and headings of the books, sections and<br />
chapters given in this work as well as the explanations associated with them, are made to facilitate a<br />
preliminary survey and strictly are only of historical value. They do not belong to the content and body of the<br />
science but are compilations of an external reflection which has already run through the whole of the<br />
exposition and consequently knows and indicates in advance the sequence of its moments before these are<br />
brought forward by the subject matter itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 65<br />
Similarly in the other sciences, such preliminary definitions and divisions are in themselves nothing else but<br />
such external indications; but even within the particular science they are not raised above this status. Even in<br />
logic, for example, we may be told perhaps that &#39;logic has two main parts, the theory of elements and<br />
methodology&#39;, then under the former there straightway follows perhaps the superscription, Laws of Thought;<br />
and then, Chapter I: Concepts. First Section: Of the Clearness of Concepts, and so on. These definitions and<br />
divisions, made without any deduction or justification, constitute the systematic framework and the entire<br />
connectedness of such sciences. Such a logic regards it as its vocation to talk about the necessity of deducing<br />
concepts and truths from principles; but as regards what it calls method, the thought of a deduction of it<br />
simply does not occur to it. The procedure consists, perhaps, in grouping together what is similar and making<br />
what is simple precede what is complex, and other external considerations.<br />
But as regards any inner, necessary connectedness, there is nothing more than the list of headings of the<br />
various parts and the transition is effected simply by saying Chapter II, or We come now to the judgements,<br />
and the like.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 66<br />
The superscriptions and divisions, too, which appear in this system are not themselves intended to have any<br />
other significance than that of a list of contents. Besides, the immanent coming&minus;to&minus;be of the distinctions and<br />
the necessity of their connection with each other must present themselves in the exposition of the subject<br />
matter itself for it falls within the spontaneous progressive determination of the Notion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 67<br />
That which enables the Notion to advance itself is the already mentioned negative which it possesses within<br />
itself; it is this which constitutes the genuine dialectical moment. Dialectic in this way acquires an entirely<br />
different significance from what it had when it was considered as a separate part of Logic and when its aim<br />
and standpoint were, one may say, completely misunderstood. Even the Platonic dialectic, in the Parmenides<br />
itself and elsewhere even more directly, on the one hand, aims only at abolishing and refuting assertions<br />
through themselves and on the other hand, has for its result simply nothingness.<br />
Dialectic is commonly regarded as an external, negative activity which does not pertain to the subject matter<br />
itself, having its ground in mere conceit as a subjective itch for unsettling and destroying what is fixed and<br />
substantial, or at least having for its result nothing but the worthlessness of the object dialectically<br />
considered.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 68<br />
Kant rated dialectic higher &minus;&minus; and this is among his greatest merits &minus;&minus; for he freed it from the seeming<br />
arbitrariness which it possesses from the standpoint of ordinary thought and exhibited it as a necessary<br />
function of reason. Because dialectic was held to be merely the art of practising deceptions and producing<br />
illusions, the assumption was made forthwith that it is only a spurious game, the whole of its power resting<br />
solely on concealment of the deceit and that its results are obtained only surreptitiously and are a subjective<br />
illusion. True, Kant&#39;s expositions in the antinomies of pure reason, when closely examined as they will be at<br />
length in the course of this work, do not indeed deserve any great praise; but the general idea on which he<br />
based his expositions and which he vindicated, is the objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the<br />
contradiction which belongs to the nature of thought determinations: primarily, it is true, with the<br />
significance that these determinations are applied by reason to things in themselves; but their nature is<br />
precisely what they are in reason and with reference to what is intrinsic or in itself.<br />
This result, grasped in its positive aspect, is nothing else but the inner negativity of the determinations as their<br />
self&minus;moving soul, the principle of all natural and spiritual life.<br />
But if no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only the familiar one<br />
that reason is incapable of knowing the infinite; a strange result for &minus;&minus; since the infinite is the Reasonable &minus;&minus;<br />
it asserts that reason is incapable of knowing the Reasonable.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 69<br />
It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of opposites in their unity or of the<br />
positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists.<br />
It is the most important aspect of dialectic, but for thinking which is as yet unpractised and unfree it is the<br />
most difficult. Such thinking, if it is still engaged in breaking itself of the habit of employing sensuously<br />
concrete terms and of ratiocination, must first practise abstract thinking, hold fast Notions in their<br />
determinateness and learn to cognise by means of them. An exposition of logic to this end would, in its<br />
method, have to keep to the division of the subject above&minus;mentioned and with regard to the more detailed<br />
contents, to the definitions given for the particular Notions without touching on the dialectical aspect. As<br />
regards its external &#39;structure, such an exposition would resemble the usual presentation of this science, but it<br />
would also be distinguished from it with respect to the content and still would serve for practice in abstract<br />
thinking, though not in speculative thinking, a purpose which can never be realised by the logic which has<br />
become popular through the addition of psychological and anthropological material. It would give to mind<br />
the picture of a methodically ordered whole, although the soul of the structure, the method (which dwells in<br />
the dialectical aspect) would not itself appear in it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 70<br />
Finally, with respect to education and the relation of the individual to logic, I would further remark that this<br />
science, like grammar, appears in two different aspects or values. It is one thing for him who comes to it and<br />
the sciences generally for the first time, but it is another thing for him who comes back to it from these<br />
sciences. He who begins the study of grammar finds in its forms and laws dry abstractions, arbitrary rules, in<br />
general an isolated collection of definitions and terms which exhibit only the value and significance of what<br />
is implied in their immediate meaning; there is nothing to be known in them other than themselves. On the<br />
other hand, he who has mastered a language and at the same time has a comparative knowledge of other<br />
languages, he alone can make contact with the spirit and culture of a people through the grammar of its<br />
language; the same rules and forms now have a substantial, living value. Similarly, he who approaches this<br />
science at first finds in logic an isolated system of abstractions which, confined within itself, does not<br />
embrace within its scope the other knowledges and sciences.<br />
On the contrary, when contrasted with the wealth of the world as pictorially conceived, with the apparently<br />
real content of the other sciences, and compared with the promise of absolute science to unveil the essential<br />
being of this wealth, the inner nature of mind and the world, the truth, then this science in its abstract shape,<br />
in the colourless, cold simplicity of its pure determinations looks as if it could achieve anything sooner than<br />
the fulfilment of its promise and seems to confront that richness as an empty, insubstantial form. The first<br />
acquaintance with logic confines its significance to itself alone; its content passes only for a detached<br />
occupation with the determinations of thought, alongside which other scientific activities possess on their<br />
own account a matter and content of their own, on which logic may perhaps have a formal influence, though<br />
an influence which comes only from itself and which if necessary can of course also be dispensed with so far<br />
as the scientific structure and its study are concerned.<br />
The other sciences have on the whole discarded the correct method, that is, a sequence of definitions, axioms,<br />
theorems and their proofs, etc.; so&minus;called natural logic now has its own validity in the sciences and manages<br />
to get along without any special knowledge of the nature of thought itself. But the matter and content of these<br />
sciences is held to be completely independent of logic and also has more appeal for sense, feeling, figurate<br />
conception, and practical interest of any kind.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 71<br />
At first, therefore, logic must indeed be learnt as something which one understands and sees into quite well<br />
but in which, at the beginning, one feels the lack of scope and depth and a wider significance. It is only after<br />
profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract<br />
universal and reveals itself as the universal which embraces within itself the wealth of the particular &minus;&minus; just<br />
as the same proverb, in the mouth of a youth who understands it quite well, does not possess the wide range<br />
of meaning which it has in the mind of a man with the experience of a lifetime behind him, for who, the<br />
meaning is expressed in all its power. Thus the value of logic is only apprehended when it is preceded by<br />
experience of the sciences; it then displays itself to mind as the universal truth, not as a particular knowledge<br />
alongside other matters and realities, but as the essential being of all these latter.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 72<br />
Now although the mind is not conscious of this power of logic at the beginning of its study, it none the less<br />
receives within itself through such study the power which leads it into all truth. The system of logic is the<br />
realm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities freed from all sensuous concreteness. The study of this<br />
science, to dwell and labour in this shadowy realm, is the absolute culture and discipline of consciousness. In<br />
logic, consciousness is busy with something remote from sensuous intuitions and aims, from feelings, from<br />
the merely imagined world of figurate conception. Considered from its negative aspect, this business consists<br />
in holding off the contingency of ordinary thinking and the arbitrary selection of particular grounds &minus;&minus; or<br />
their opposites &minus;&minus; as valid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 73<br />
But above all, thought acquires thereby self&minus;reliance and independence. It becomes at home in abstractions<br />
and in progressing by means of Notions free from sensuous substrata, develops an unsuspected power of<br />
assimilating in rational form all the various knowledges and sciences in their complex variety, of grasping<br />
and retaining them in their essential character, stripping them of their external features and in this way<br />
extracting from them the logical element, or what is the same thing, filling the abstract basis of Logic<br />
acquired by study with the substantial content of absolute truth and giving it the value of a universal which no<br />
longer stands as a particular alongside other particulars but includes them all within its grasp and is their<br />
essence, the absolutely True.<br />
<br />
General Division of Logic<br />
&sect; 74<br />
From what has been said about the Notion of this science and where its justification is to be found, it follows<br />
that the general division of it here can only be provisional, can be given, as it were, only in so far as the<br />
author is already familiar with the science and consequently is historically in a position to state here in<br />
advance the main distinctions which will emerge in the development of the Notion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 75<br />
Still, the attempt can be made to promote an understanding beforehand of what is requisite for such a<br />
division, even though in doing so we must have recourse to an application of the method which will only be<br />
fully understood and justified within the science itself. We must therefore point out at the start that we are<br />
presupposing that the division must be connected with the Notion, or rather must be implicit in the Notion<br />
itself. The Notion is not indeterminate but is in its own self determinate; the division, however, expresses this<br />
its determinateness as developed; it is the judgement of the Notion, not a judgement about some object or<br />
other picked up from outside, but the judging, that is, determining, of the Notion in its own self.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 76<br />
The quality of being right&minus;angled, acute&minus;angled or equilateral, according to which triangles are classified, is<br />
not implicit in the determinateness of the triangle itself, that is, not in what is usually called the Notion of the<br />
triangle, just as little as there is implicit in what passes for the Notion of animal as such, or of the mammal,<br />
bird, etc. the determinations governing the classification into mammal, bird, etc., and the subdivision of these<br />
classes into other species. Such determinations are taken from elsewhere and are annexed to such so&minus;called<br />
Notion from outside. In the philosophical treatment of classification or division, the Notion itself must show<br />
that it is itself the course of those determinations.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 77<br />
But in the Introduction, the Notion of logic was itself stated to be the result of a preceding science, and so<br />
here, too, it is a presupposition. In accordance with that result logic was defined as the science of pure<br />
thought, the principle of which is pure knowing, the unity which is not abstract but a living, concrete unity in<br />
virtue of the fact that in it the opposition in consciousness between a self&minus;determined entity, a subject, and a<br />
second such entity, an object, is known to be overcome; being is known to be the pure Notion in its own self,<br />
and the pure Notion to be the true being. These, then, are the two moments contained in logic. But now they<br />
are known to be inseparable, not as in consciousness where each also has a separate being of its own; it is<br />
solely because they are at the same time known as distinct (yet not with an independent being) that their unity<br />
is not abstract, dead and inert, but concrete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 78<br />
This unity also constitutes the logical principle as element, so that the development of the difference directly<br />
present in that principle proceeds only within this element. For since the division is, as we have said, the<br />
judgement of the Notion, the positing of the determination already immanent in it, and therefore of the<br />
difference, we must not understand this positing as a resolving of that concrete unity back into its<br />
determinations as if these had an independent self&minus;subsistence, for this would be an empty return to the<br />
previous standpoint, to the opposition of consciousness. This however has vanished; the said unity remains<br />
the element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development no longer originate outside that<br />
element. Consequently the earlier determinations (those used on the pathway to truth) such as subjectivity&nbsp;and objectivity, or even thought and being, or Notion and reality, no matter from what standpoint they were<br />
determined, have lost their independent and purely affirmative character and are now in their truth, that is, in<br />
their unity, reduced to forms. In their difference, therefore, they themselves remain implicitly the whole<br />
Notion, and this, in the division, is posited only under its own specifications.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 79<br />
Thus what is to be considered is the whole Notion, firstly as the Notion in the form of being, secondly, as the<br />
Notion; in the first case, the Notion is only in itself, the Notion of reality or being; in the second case, it is the<br />
Notion as such, the Notion existing for itself (as it is, to name concrete forms, in thinking man, and even in<br />
the sentient animal and in organic individuality generally, although, of course, in these it is not conscious,<br />
still less known; it is only in inorganic nature that it is in itself). Accordingly, logic should be divided<br />
primarily into the logic of the Notion as being and of the Notion as Notion &minus;&minus; or, by employing the usual<br />
terms (although these as least definite are most ambiguous) into &#39;objective&#39; and &#39;subjective&#39; logic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 80<br />
But in accordance with the fundamental element of the immanent unity of the Notion, and hence with the<br />
inseparability of its determinations, these latter, when distinguished from each other in the positing of the<br />
Notion in its difference, must at least also stand in relation to each other. There results a sphere of mediation,<br />
the Notion as a system of reflected determinations, that is, of being in process of transition into the<br />
being&minus;within&minus;self or inwardness of the Notion. In this way, the Notion is not yet posited as such for itself,<br />
but is still fettered by the externality of immediate being. This is the doctrine of essence which stands<br />
midway between the doctrine of being and that of the Notion. In the general division of logic in the present<br />
work it has been included in objective logic because although essence is already the inwardness of being, the<br />
character of subject is to be expressly reserved for the Notion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 81<br />
Recently Kant has opposed to what has usually been called logic another, namely, a transcendental logic.<br />
What has here been called objective logic would correspond in part to what with him is transcendental logic.<br />
He distinguishes it from what he calls general logic in this way, [a] that it treats of the notions which refer a<br />
priori to objects, and consequently does not abstract from the whole content of objective cognition, or, in<br />
other words, it contains the rules of the pure thinking of an object, and [b] at the same time it treats of the<br />
origin of our cognition so far as this cognition cannot be ascribed to the objects. It is to this second aspect that<br />
Kant&#39;s philosophical interest is exclusively directed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 82<br />
His chief thought is to vindicate the categories for self&minus;consciousness as the subjective ego. By virtue of this<br />
determination and its opposition; and besides the empirical element of feeling and intuition it has something<br />
else left over which is not posited and determined by thinking self&minus;consciousness, a thing&minus;in&minus;itself,<br />
something alien and external to thought &minus;&minus; although it is easy to perceive that such an abstraction as the<br />
thing&minus;in&minus;itself is itself only a product of thought, and of merely abstractive thought at that. If other disciples<br />
of Kant have expressed themselves concerning the determining of the object by the ego in this way, that the<br />
objectifying of the ego is to be regarded as an original and necessary act of consciousness, so that in this<br />
original act there is not yet the idea of the ego itself &minus;&minus; which would be a consciousness of that consciousness<br />
or even an objectifying of it &minus;&minus; then this objectifying act, in its freedom from the opposition of<br />
consciousness, is nearer to what may be taken simply for thought as such. [2]<br />
Footnote<br />
<br />
1. I would mention that in this work I frequently refer to the Kantian philosophy (which to many may seem<br />
superfluous) because whatever may be said, both in this work and elsewhere, about the precise character of<br />
this philosophy and about particular parts of its exposition, it constitutes the base and the starting point of<br />
recent German philosophy and that its merit remains unaffected by whatever faults may be found in it. The<br />
reason too why reference must often be made to it in the objective logic is that it enters into detailed<br />
consideration of important, more specific aspects of logic, whereas later philosophical works have paid little<br />
attention to these and in some instances have only displayed a crude &minus;&minus; not unavenged &minus;&minus; contempt for them.<br />
The philosophising which is most widespread among us does not go beyond the Kantian results, that Reason<br />
cannot acquire knowledge of any true content or subject matter and in regard to absolute truth must be<br />
directed to faith. But what with Kant is a result, forms the immediate starting&minus;point in this philosophising, so<br />
that the preceding exposition from which that result issued and which is a philosophical cognition, is cut<br />
away beforehand. The Kantian philosophy thus serves as a cushion for intellectual indolence which soothes<br />
itself with the conviction that everything is already proved and settled. Consequently for genuine knowledge,<br />
for a specific content of thought which is not to be found in such barren and arid complacency, one must turn<br />
to that preceding exposition.<br />
2. If the expression &#39;objectifying act of the ego&#39; suggests other products of spirit, e.g. fantasy, it is to be<br />
observed that we are speaking of a determining of an object in so far as the elements of its content do not<br />
belong to feeling and intuition. Such an object is a thought, and to determine it means partly, first to produce<br />
it, partly, in so far as it is something presupposed, to have further thoughts about it, to develop it further by<br />
thought.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 83<br />
But this act should no longer be called consciousness; consciousness embraces within itself the opposition of<br />
the ego and its object which is not present in that original act. The name consciousness gives it a semblance<br />
of subjectivity even more than does the term thought, which here, however, is to be taken simply in the<br />
absolute sense as infinite thought untainted by the finitude of consciousness, in short, thought as such.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 84<br />
Now because the interest of the Kantian philosophy was directed to the so&minus;called transcendental aspect of the<br />
categories, the treatment of the categories themselves yielded a blank result; what they are in themselves<br />
without the abstract relation to the ego common to all, what is their specific nature relatively to each other<br />
and their relationship to each other, this has not been made an object of consideration. Hence this philosophy<br />
has not contributed in the slightest to a knowledge of their nature; what alone is of interest in this connection<br />
occurs in the Critique of Ideas. But if philosophy was to make any real progress, it was necessary that the<br />
interest of thought should be drawn to a consideration of the formal side, to a consideration of the ego, of<br />
consciousness as such, i.e. of the abstract relation of a subjective knowing to an object, so that in this way the<br />
cognition of the infinite form, that is, of the Notion, would be introduced. But in order that this cognition may<br />
be reached, that form has still to be relieved of the finite determinateness in which it is ego, or consciousness.<br />
The form, when thus thought out into its purity, will have within itself the capacity to determine itself, that is,<br />
to give itself a content, and that a necessarily explicated content in the form of a system of determinations of<br />
thought.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 85<br />
The objective logic, then, takes the place rather of the former metaphysics which was intended to be the<br />
scientific construction of the world in terms of thoughts alone. If we have regard to the final shape of this<br />
science, then it is first and immediately ontology whose place is taken by objective logic &minus;&minus; that part of this<br />
metaphysics which was supposed to investigate the nature of ens in general; ens comprises both being and<br />
essence, a distinction for which the German language has fortunately preserved different terms. But further,<br />
objective logic also comprises the rest of metaphysics in so far as this attempted to comprehend with the<br />
forms of pure thought particular substrata taken primarily from figurate conception, namely the soul, the<br />
world and God; and the determinations of thought constituted what was essential in the mode of<br />
consideration. Logic, however, considers these forms free from those substrata, from the subjects of figurate<br />
conception; it considers them, their nature and worth, in their own proper character. Former metaphysics<br />
omitted to do this and consequently incurred the just reproach of having employed these forms uncritically<br />
without a preliminary investigation as to whether and how they were capable of being determinations of the<br />
thing&minus;in&minus;itself, to use the Kantian expression &minus;&minus; or rather of the Reasonable. Objective logic is therefore the<br />
genuine critique of them &minus;&minus; a critique which does not consider them as contrasted under the abstract forms of<br />
the a priori and the a posteriori, but considers the determinations themselves according to their specific<br />
content.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 86<br />
The subjective logic is the logic of the Notion, of essence which has sublated its relation to being or its<br />
illusory being [Schein], and in its determination is no longer external but is subjective free, self&minus;subsistent<br />
and self&minus;determining, or rather it is the subject itself. Since subjectivity brings with it the misconception of<br />
contingency and caprice and, in general, characteristics belonging to the form of consciousness, no particular<br />
importance is to be attached here to the distinction of subjective and objective; these determinations will be<br />
more precisely developed later on in the logic itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 87<br />
Logic thus falls generally into objective and subjective logic, but more specifically it has three parts:<br />
<strong>I The logic of being<br />
II The logic of essence, and<br />
III The logic of the Notion</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">With What must Science Begin?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 88<br />
It is only in recent times that thinkers have become aware of the difficulty of finding a beginning in<br />
philosophy, and the reason for this difficulty and also the possibility of resolving it has been much discussed.<br />
What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate, and it is easy to show that it can be<br />
neither the one nor the other; thus either way of beginning is refuted.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 89<br />
The principle of a philosophy does, of course, also express a beginning, but not so much a subjective as an<br />
objective one, the beginning of everything. The principle is a particular determinate content &minus;&minus; water, the<br />
one, nous, idea, substance, monad, etc. Or, if it refers to the nature of cognition and consequently is supposed<br />
to be only a criterion rather than an objective determination &minus;&minus; thought, intuition, sensation, ego, subjectivity<br />
itself. Then here too it is the nature of the content which is the point of interest. The beginning as such, on the<br />
other hand, as something subjective in the sense of being a particular, inessential way of introducing the<br />
discourse, remains unconsidered, a matter of indifference, and so too the need to find an answer to the<br />
question, With what should the beginning be made? remains of no importance in face of the need for a<br />
principle in which alone the interest of the matter in hand seems to lie, the interest as to what is the truth, the<br />
absolute ground.<br />
<br />
&sect; 90<br />
But the modern perplexity about a beginning proceeds from a further requirement of which those who are<br />
concerned with the dogmatic demonstration of a principle or who are sceptical about finding a subjective<br />
criterion against dogmatic philosophising, are not yet aware, and which is completely denied by those who<br />
begin, like a shot from a pistol, from their inner revelation, from faith, intellectual Intuition, etc., and who<br />
would be exempt from method and logic. If earlier abstract thought was interested in the principle only as<br />
content, but in the course of philosophical development has been impelled to pay attention to the other side,<br />
to the behaviour of the cognitive process, this implies that the subjective act has also been grasped as an<br />
essential moment of objective truth, and this brings with it the need to unite the method with the content, the<br />
form with the principle. Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thought<br />
ought also to be the first in the process of thinking.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 91<br />
Here we have only to consider how the logical beginning appears; the two sides from which it can be taken<br />
have already been named, to wit, either as a mediated result or as a beginning proper, as an immediacy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 92<br />
This is not the place to deal with the question apparently so important in present&minus;day thought, whether the<br />
knowledge of truth is an immediate knowledge having a pure beginning, a faith, or whether it is a mediated<br />
knowledge . In so far as this can be dealt with preliminarily it has been done elsewhere. Here we need only<br />
quote from it this, there is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which does<br />
not equally contain both immediacy and mediation, so that these two determinations reveal themselves to be<br />
unseparated and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity. But as regards the philosophical<br />
discussion of this, it is to be found in every logical proposition in which occur the determinations of<br />
immediacy and mediation and consequently also the discussion of their opposition and their truth. Inasmuch<br />
as this opposition, as related to thinking, to knowing, to cognition, acquires the more concrete form of<br />
immediate of mediated knowledge, it is the nature of cognition as such which is considered within the science<br />
of logic, while the more concrete form of cognition falls to be considered in the philosophy of spirit. But to<br />
want the nature of cognition clarified prior to the science is to demand that it be considered outside the<br />
science; outside the science this cannot be accomplished, at least not in a scientific manner and such a manner<br />
is alone here in place.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 93<br />
The beginning is logical in that it is to be made in the element of thought that is free and for itself, in pure<br />
knowing. It is mediated because pure knowing is the ultimate, absolute truth of consciousness. In the<br />
Introduction it was remarked that the phenomenology of spirit is the science of consciousness, the exposition<br />
of it, and that consciousness has for result the Notion of science, i.e. pure knowing. Logic, then, has for its<br />
presupposition the science of manifested spirit, which contains and demonstrates the necessity, and so the<br />
truth, of the standpoint occupied by pure knowing and of its mediation. In this science of manifested spirit the<br />
beginning is made from empirical, sensuous consciousness and this is immediate knowledge in the strict<br />
sense of the word; in that work there is discussed the significance of this immediate knowledge. Other forms<br />
of consciousness such as belief in divine truths, inner experience, knowledge through inner revelation, etc.,<br />
are very ill&minus;fitted to be quoted as examples of immediate knowledge as a little reflection will show. In the<br />
work just mentioned immediate consciousness is also the first and that which is immediate in the science<br />
itself, and therefore the presupposition; but in logic, the presupposition is that which has proved itself to be<br />
the result of that phenomenological consideration &minus;&minus; the Idea as pure knowledge.<br />
<br />
&sect; 94<br />
Logic is pure science, that is, pure knowledge in the entire range of its development. But in the said result,<br />
this Idea has determined itself to be the certainty which has become truth, the certainty which, on the one<br />
hand, no longer has the object over against it but has internalised it, knows it as its own self &minus;&minus; and, on the<br />
other hand, has given up the knowledge of itself as of something confronting the object of which it is only the<br />
annihilation, has divested itself of this subjectivity and is at one with its self&minus;alienation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 95<br />
Now starting from this, determination of pure knowledge, all that is needed to ensure that the beginning<br />
remains immanent in its scientific development is to consider, or rather, ridding oneself of all other<br />
reflections and opinions whatever, simply to take up, what is there before us.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 96<br />
Pure knowing as concentrated into this unity has sublated all reference to an other and to mediation; it is<br />
without any distinction and as thus distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge; what is present is only<br />
simple immediacy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 97<br />
Simple immediacy is itself an expression of reflection and contains a reference to its distinction from what is<br />
mediated. This simple immediacy, therefore, in its true expression is pure being. Just as pure knowing is to<br />
mean knowing as such, quite abstractly, so too pure being is to mean nothing but being in general: being, and<br />
nothing else, without any further specification and filling.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 98<br />
Here the beginning is made with being which is represented as having come to be through mediation, a<br />
mediation which is also a sublating of itself; and there is presupposed pure knowing as the outcome of finite<br />
knowing, of consciousness. But if no presupposition is to be made and the beginning itself is taken<br />
immediately, then its only determination is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. All that<br />
is present is simply the resolve, which can also be regarded as arbitrary, that we propose to consider thought<br />
as such.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 99<br />
Thus the beginning must be an absolute, or what is synonymous here, an abstract beginning; and so it may<br />
not suppose anything, must not be mediated by anything nor have a ground; rather it is to be itself the ground<br />
of the entire science. Consequently, it must be purely and simply an immediacy, or rather merely immediacy<br />
itself. Just as it cannot possess any determination relatively to anything else, so too it cannot contain within<br />
itself any determination, any content; for any such would be a distinguishing and an inter&minus;relationship of<br />
distinct moments, and consequently a mediation. The beginning therefore is pure being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 100<br />
To this simple exposition of what is only directly involved in the simplest of all things, the logical beginning,<br />
we may add the following further reflections; yet these cannot be meant to serve as elucidations and<br />
confirmations of that exposition &minus;&minus; this is complete in itself &minus;&minus; since they are occasioned by preconceived<br />
ideas and reflections and these, like all other preliminary prejudices, must be disposed of within the science<br />
itself where their treatment should be awaited with patience.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 101<br />
The insight that absolute truth must be a result, and conversely, that a result presupposes a prior truth which,<br />
however, because it is a first, objectively considered is unnecessary and from the subjective side is not known<br />
&minus;&minus; this insight has recently given rise to the thought that philosophy can only begin with a hypothetical and<br />
problematical truth and therefore philosophising can at first be only a quest. This view was much stressed by<br />
Reinhold in his later philosophical work and one must give it credit for the genuine interest on which it is<br />
based, an interest which concerns the speculative nature of the philosophical beginning. The detailed<br />
discussion of this view is at the same time an occasion for introducing a preliminary understanding of the<br />
meaning of progress in logic generally; for that view has a direct bearing on the advance; this it conceives to<br />
be such that progress in philosophy is rather a retrogression and a grounding or establishing by means of<br />
which we first obtain the result that what we began with is not something merely arbitrarily assumed but is in<br />
fact the truth, and also the primary truth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 102<br />
It must be admitted that it is an important consideration &minus;&minus; one which will be found in more detail in the<br />
logic itself &minus;&minus; that the advance is a retreat into the ground, to what is primary and true, on which depends<br />
and, in fact, from which originates, that with which the beginning is made. Thus consciousness on its onward<br />
path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth. This<br />
last, the ground, is then also that from which the first proceeds, that which at first appeared as an immediacy.<br />
This is true in still greater measure of absolute spirit which reveals itself as the concrete and final supreme<br />
truth of all being, and which at the end of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoning<br />
itself to the shape of an immediate being &minus;&minus;opening or unfolding itself [sich entschliessend] into the creation<br />
of a world which contains all that fell into the development which preceded that result and which through this<br />
reversal of its position relatively to its beginning is transformed into something dependent on the result as<br />
principle. The essential requirement for the science of logic is not so much that the beginning be a pure<br />
immediacy, but rather that the whole of the science be within itself a circle in which the first is also the last<br />
and the last is also the first.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 103<br />
We see therefore that, on the other hand, it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the<br />
movement returns as into its ground. In this respect the first is equally the ground, and the last a derivative;<br />
since the movement starts from the first and by correct inferences arrives at the last as the ground, this latter<br />
is a result. Further, the progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further<br />
determination of it, hence that which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of all<br />
that follows and does not vanish from it. The progress does not consist merely in the derivation of an other, or<br />
in the effected transition into a genuine other; and in so far as this transition does occur it is equally sublated<br />
again. Thus the beginning of philosophy is the foundation which is present and preserved throughout the<br />
entire subsequent development, remaining completely immanent in its further determinations.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 104<br />
Through this progress, then, the beginning loses the one&minus;sidedness which attaches to it as something simply<br />
immediate and abstract; it becomes something mediated, and hence the line of the scientific advance becomes<br />
a circle. It also follows that because that which forms the beginning is still undeveloped, devoid of content, it<br />
is not truly known in the beginning; it is the science of logic in its whole compass which first constitutes the<br />
completed knowledge of it with its developed content and first truly grounds that knowledge.<br />
<br />
&sect; 105<br />
But because it is the result which appears as the absolute ground, this progress in knowing is not something<br />
provisional, or problematical and hypothetical; it must be determined by the nature of the subject matter itself<br />
and its content.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 106<br />
The said beginning is neither an arbitrary and merely provisional assumption, nor is it something which<br />
appears to be arbitrarily and tentatively presupposed, but which is subsequently shown to have been properly<br />
made the beginning; not as is the case with the constructions one is directed to make in connection with the<br />
proof of a theorem in geometry, where it becomes apparent only afterwards in the proof that one took the<br />
right course in drawing just those lines and then, in the proof itself, in beginning with the comparison of those<br />
lines or angles; drawing such lines and comparing them are not an essential part of the proof itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 107<br />
Thus the ground, the reason, why the beginning is made with pure being in the pure science [of logic] is<br />
directly given in the science itself. This pure being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws, or, if this<br />
itself is still to be distinguished as form from its unity, then being is also the content of pure knowing. It is<br />
when taken in this way that this pure being, this absolute immediacy has equally the character of something<br />
absolutely mediated. But it is equally essential that it be taken only in the one&minus;sided character in which it is<br />
pure immediacy, precisely because here it is the beginning. If it were not this pure indeterminateness, if it<br />
were determinate, it would have been taken as something mediated, something already carried a stage further:<br />
what is determinate implies an other to a first. Therefore, it lies in the very nature of a beginning that it must<br />
be being and nothing else. To enter into philosophy, therefore, calls for no other preparations, no further<br />
reflections or points of connection.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 108<br />
We cannot really extract any further determination or positive content for the beginning from the fact that it is<br />
the beginning of philosophy. For here at the start, where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand,<br />
philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception. Pure knowing yields only this<br />
negative determination, that the beginning is to be abstract. If pure being is taken as the content of pure<br />
knowing, then the latter must stand back from its content, allowing it to have free play and not determining it<br />
further. Or again, if pure being is to be considered as the unity into which knowing has collapsed at the<br />
extreme point of its union with the object, then knowing itself has vanished in that unity, leaving behind no<br />
difference from the unity and hence nothing by which the latter could be determined. Nor is there anything<br />
else present, any content which could be used to make the beginning more determinate.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 109<br />
But the determination of being so far adopted for the beginning could also be omitted, so that the only<br />
demand would be that a pure beginning be made. In that case, we have nothing but the beginning itself, and it<br />
remains to be seen what this is. This position could also be suggested for the benefit of those who, on the one<br />
hand, are dissatisfied for one reason or another with the beginning with being and still more so with the<br />
resulting transition of being into nothing, and, on the other hand, simply know no other way of beginning a<br />
science than by presupposing some general idea, which is then analysed, the result of such analysis yielding<br />
the first specific concept in the science. If we too were to observe this method, then we should be without a<br />
particular object, because the beginning, as the beginning of thought, is supposed to be quite abstract, quite<br />
general, wholly form without any content; thus we should have nothing at all beyond the general idea of a<br />
mere beginning as such. We have therefore only to see what is contained in such an idea.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 110<br />
As yet there is nothing and there is to become something the beginning is not pure nothing, but a nothing<br />
from which something is to proceed; therefore being, too, is already contained in the beginning. The<br />
beginning therefore contains both, being and nothing, is the unity of being and nothing; or is non&minus;being<br />
which is at the same time being, and being which is at the same time non&minus;being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 111<br />
Further, in the beginning, being and nothing are present as distinguished from each other; for the beginning<br />
points to something else &minus;&minus; it is a non&minus;being which carries a reference to being as to an other; that which<br />
begins, as yet is not, it is only on the way to being.<br />
That which begins, as yet is not, it is only on the way to being. The being contained in the beginning is,<br />
therefore, a being which removed itself from non&minus;being or sublates it as something opposed to it.<br />
But again, that which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet. The opposites, being and non&minus;being<br />
are therefore directly united in it, or, otherwise expressed, it is their undifferentiated unity.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 112<br />
The analysis of the beginning would thus yield the notion of the unity of being and nothing &minus;&minus; or, in a more<br />
reflected form, the unity of differentiatedness and non&minus;differentiatedness, or the identity of identity and<br />
non&minus;identity. This concept could be regarded as the first, purest, that is, most abstract definition of the<br />
absolute &minus;&minus; as it would in fact be if we were at all concerned with the form of definitions and with the name<br />
of the absolute. In this sense, that abstract concept would be the first definition of this absolute and all further<br />
determinations and developments only more specific and richer definitions of it. But let those who are<br />
dissatisfied with being as a beginning because it passes over into nothing and so gives rise to the unity of<br />
being and nothing, let them see whether they find this beginning which begins with the general idea of a<br />
beginning and with its analysis (which, though of course correct, likewise leads to the unity of being and<br />
nothing), more satisfactory than the beginning with being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 113<br />
But there is a still further observation to be made about this procedure. The said analysis presupposes as<br />
familiar the idea of a beginning, thus following the example of other sciences. These presuppose their<br />
subject&minus;matter and take it for granted that everyone has roughly the same general idea of it and can find in it<br />
the same determinations as those indicated by the sciences which have obtained them in one way or another<br />
through analysis, comparison and other kinds of reasoning. But that which forms the absolute beginning must<br />
likewise be something otherwise known; now if it is something concrete and hence is variously determined<br />
within itself, then this internal relation is presupposed as something known; it is thus put forward as an<br />
immediacy which, however, it is not; for it is a relation only as a relation of distinct moments, and it therefore<br />
contains mediation within itself. Further, with a concrete object, the analysis and the ways in which it is<br />
determined are affected by contingency and arbitrariness. Which determinations are brought out depends on<br />
what each person just finds in his own immediate, contingent idea. The relation contained in something<br />
concrete, in a synthetic unity, is necessary only in so far as it is not just given but is produced by the<br />
spontaneous return of the moments back into this unity &minus;&minus; a movement which is the opposite of the analytical<br />
procedure, which is an activity belonging to the subject&minus;thinker and external to the subject matter itself.<br />
<br />
&sect; 114<br />
The foregoing shows quite clearly the reason why the beginning cannot be made with anything concrete,<br />
anything containing a relation within itself. For such presupposes an internal process of mediation and<br />
transition of which the concrete, now become simple, would be the result. But the beginning ought not itself<br />
to be already a first and an other; for anything which is in its own self a first and an other implies that an<br />
advance has already been made. Consequently, that which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, is to<br />
be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple, unfilled immediacy, and therefore as being, as the<br />
completely empty being.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 115<br />
If impatience with the consideration of the abstract beginning should provoke anyone to say that the<br />
beginning should be made not with the beginning, but straightway with the subject matter itself, well then,<br />
this subject matter is nothing else but the said empty being; for what this subject matter is, that will be<br />
explicated only in the development of the science and cannot be presupposed by it as known beforehand.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 116<br />
Whatever other form the beginning takes in the attempt to begin with something other than empty being, it<br />
will suffer from the defects already specified. Let those who are still dissatisfied with this beginning tackle<br />
the problem of avoiding these defects by beginning in some other way.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 117<br />
But we cannot leave entirely unmentioned an original beginning of philosophy which has recently become<br />
famous, the beginning with the ego. It came partly from the reflection that from the first truth the entire<br />
sequel must be derived, and partly from the requirement that the first truth must be something with which we<br />
are acquainted, and still more, something of which we are immediately certain. This beginning is, in general,<br />
not a contingent idea which can be differently constituted in different subjects. For the ego, this immediate<br />
consciousness of self, at first appears to be itself both an immediacy and also something much more familiar<br />
to us than any other idea; anything else known belongs to the ego, it is true, but is still a content distinguished<br />
from it and therefore contingent; the ego, on the contrary, is the simple certainty of its own self.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 118<br />
But the ego as such is at the same time also concrete, or rather, the ego is the most concrete of all things &minus;&minus;<br />
the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world. Before the ego, this concrete Being, can be made<br />
the beginning and ground of philosophy, it must be disrupted &minus;&minus; this is the absolute act through which the<br />
ego purges itself of its content and becomes aware of itself as an abstract ego. Only this pure ego now is not<br />
immediate, is not the familiar, ordinary ego of our consciousness to which the science of logic could be<br />
directly linked for everyone. That act, strictly speaking, would be nothing else but the elevation to the<br />
standpoint of pure knowing where the distinction of subject and object has vanished. But as thus immediately<br />
demanded, this elevation is a subjective postulate; to prove itself a genuine demand, the progression of the<br />
concrete ego from immediate consciousness to pure knowing must have been indicated and exhibited through<br />
the necessity of the ego itself. Without this objective movement pure knowing, even in the shape of<br />
intellectual intuition, appears as an arbitrary standpoint, or even as one of the empirical states of<br />
consciousness with respect to which everything turns on whether or not it is found or can be produced in each<br />
and every individual. But inasmuch as this pure ego must be essential, pure knowing, and pure knowing is<br />
not immediately present in the individual consciousness but only as posited through the absolute act of the<br />
ego in raising itself to that stand&minus;point, we lose the very advantage which is supposed to come from this<br />
beginning of philosophy namely that it is something thoroughly familiar, something &#39;everyone finds in<br />
himself which can form the starting point for further reflection; that pure ego, on the contrary, in its abstract,<br />
essential nature, is something unknown to the ordinary consciousness, something it does not find therein.<br />
Instead, such a beginning brings with it the disadvantage of the illusion that whereas the thing under<br />
discussion is supposed to be something familiar, the ego of empirical self&minus;consciousness, it is in fact<br />
something far removed from it. When pure knowing is characterised as ego, it acts as a perpetual reminder of<br />
the subjective ego whose limitations should be forgotten, and it fosters the idea that the propositions and<br />
relations resulting from the further development of the ego are present and can already be found in the<br />
ordinary consciousness &minus;&minus; for in fact it is this of which they are asserted. This confusion, far from clarifying<br />
the problem of a beginning, only adds to the difficulties involved and tends completely to mislead; among&minus;<br />
the uninitiated it has given rise to the crudest misunderstandings.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 119<br />
Further, as regards the subjective determinateness of the ego in general, it is true that pure knowing frees the<br />
ego from the restricted meaning imposed on it by the insuperable opposition of its object; but for this reason<br />
it would be superfluous at least to retain this subjective attitude and the determination of pure knowing as<br />
ego. This determination, however, not only introduces the disturbing ambiguity mentioned, but closely<br />
examined it also remains a subjective ego. The actual development of the science which starts from the ego<br />
shows that in that development the object has and retains the perennial character of an other for the ego, and<br />
that the ego which formed the starting point is, therefore, still entangled in the world of appearance and is not<br />
the pure knowing which has in truth overcome the opposition of consciousness.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 120<br />
In this connection a further essential observation must be made, namely that although the ego could in itself<br />
or in principle [an sich] be characterised as pure knowing or as intellectual intuition and asserted as the<br />
beginning, we are not concerned in the science of logic with what is present only in principle or as something<br />
inner, but rather with the determinate reality in thought of what is inner and with the determinateness<br />
possessed by such an inner in this reality. But what, at the beginning of the science, is actually present of<br />
intellectual intuition&minus;or of the eternal, the divine, the absolute, if its object be so named&minus;cannot be anything<br />
else than a first, immediate, simple determination. Whatever richer name be given to it than is expressed by<br />
mere being, the consideration of such absolute must be restricted solely to the way in which it enters into our<br />
knowing as thought and is enunciated as such. True, intellectual intuition is the forcible rejection of<br />
mediation and the ratiocinative, external reflection; but what it enunciates above and beyond simple<br />
immediacy is something concrete, something which contains within itself diverse determinations. However,<br />
as we have remarked, the enunciation and exposition of such concrete beginning is a process of mediation<br />
which starts from one of the determinations and advances to the other, even though the latter returns to the<br />
first; it is a movement which at the same time may not be arbitrary or assertoric. Consequently, it is not the<br />
concrete something itself with which that exposition begins but only the simple immediacy from which the<br />
movement starts. And further, if something concrete is taken as the beginning, the conjunction of the<br />
determinations contained in it demand proof, and this is lacking.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 121<br />
If, therefore, in the expression of the absolute, or eternal, or God (and God has the absolutely undisputed right<br />
that the beginning be made with him) &minus;&minus; if in the intuition or thought of these there is implied more than pure<br />
being &minus;&minus; then this more must make its appearance in our knowing only as something thought, not as<br />
something imagined or figurately conceived; let what is present in intuition or figurate conception be as rich<br />
as it may, the determination which first emerges in knowing is simple, for only in what is simple is there<br />
nothing more than the pure beginning; only the immediate is simple, for only in the immediate has no<br />
&nbsp;Science of Logic<br />
With What must Science Begin? 33<br />
advance yet been made from a one to an other. Consequently, whatever is intended to be expressed or implied<br />
beyond being, in the richer forms of representing the absolute or God, this is in the beginning only an empty<br />
word and only being; this simple determination which has no other meaning of any kind, this emptiness, is<br />
therefore simply as such the beginning of philosophy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 122<br />
This insight is itself so simple that this beginning as such requires no preparation or further introduction; and,<br />
indeed, these preliminary, external reflections about it were not so much intended to lead up to it as rather to<br />
eliminate all preliminaries.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">General Division of Being<br />
&sect; 123<br />
Being is determined, first, as against another in general; Secondly, as immanently self&minus;determining; Thirdly,<br />
setting aside the preliminary character of this division, it is the abstract indeterminateness and immediacy in<br />
which it must be the beginning.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 124<br />
According to the first determination, being is classified as distinct from essence, for later in its development it<br />
proves to be in its totality only one sphere of the Notion and to this sphere as moment, it opposes another<br />
sphere.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 125<br />
According to the second determination, it is the sphere within which fall the determinations and the entire<br />
movement of its reflection. Here, being will posit itself in three determinations:<br />
<strong>I as determinateness as such: quality<br />
II as sublated determinateness: magnitude, quantity<br />
III as qualitatively determined quantity: measure.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 126<br />
At this stage, this division is, as was remarked of these divisions generally in the Introduction, a preliminary<br />
statement; its determinations have first to arise from the movement of being itself and in so doing define and<br />
justify themselves. As regards the divergence of this classification from the usual presentation of the<br />
categories, namely, as quantity, quality, relation and modality &minus;&minus; these moreover with Kant are supposed to<br />
be only titles for his categories though they are, in fact, themselves categories, only more general ones &minus;&minus; this<br />
calls for no special comment here, as the entire exposition will show a complete divergence from the usual<br />
arrangement and significance of the categories.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 127<br />
This only perhaps can be remarked, that hitherto the determination of quantity has been made to precede<br />
quality and this as is mostly the case &minus;&minus; for no given reason. It has already been shown that the beginning is<br />
made with being as such, therefore, with qualitative being. It is easily seen from a comparison of quality with<br />
quantity that the former by its nature is first. For quantity is quality which has already become negative;<br />
magnitude is the determinateness which is no longer one with being but is already differentiated from it,<br />
sublated quality which has become indifferent. It includes the alterableness of being, although the category<br />
itself, namely Being, of which it is the detrermination, is not altered by it. The qualitative determinateness, on<br />
the other hand, is one with its being: it neither goes beyond it nor is internal to it, but is its immediate<br />
limitedness. Quality therefore, as the immediate determinateness, is primary and it is with it that the<br />
beginning must be made.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 128<br />
Measure is a relation, but not relation in general, for it is the specific relation between quality and quantity;<br />
the categories which Kant includes under relation will come up for consideration in quite another place.<br />
Measure can also, if one wishes, be regarded as a modality; but since with Kant modality is supposed no<br />
longer to constitute a determination of the content, but to concern only the relation of the content to thought,<br />
to the subjective element, it is a quite heterogeneous relation and is not pertinent here.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&sect; 129<br />
The third determination of being falls within the section Quality, for as abstract immediacy it reduces itself to<br />
a single determinateness in relation to its other determinatenesses within its sphere.</span></p>

As we know, in the oriental systems, principally in Buddhism,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>the void, is the absolute principle. Against that simple and one-sided abstraction the deep-thinking Heraclitus brought forward the higher, total concept of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>and said:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>as little&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>as nothing is, or,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all flows</em></span>, which means,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">all is a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em></span>. The popular, especially oriental proverbs, that all that exists has the germ of death in its very birth, that death, on the other hand, is the entrance into new life, express at bottom the same union of being and nothing. But these expressions have a substratum in which the transition takes place; being and nothing are held apart in time, are conceived as alternating in it, but are not thought in their abstraction and consequently, too, not so that they are in themselves absolutely the same.&nbsp;</p>

In it is to be seen either only the empty tautology: nothing is nothing; or, if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming is</em>&nbsp;supposed to possess an actual meaning in it, then, since from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing only nothing becomes,&nbsp;</em>the proposition does not in fact contain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>for in it nothing remains nothing. Becoming implies that nothing does not remain nothing but passes into its other, into being. Later, especially Christian, metaphysics whilst rejecting the proposition that out of nothing comes nothing, asserted a transition from nothing into being; although it understood this proposition synthetically or merely imaginatively, yet even in the most imperfect union there is contained a point in which being and nothing coincide and their distinguishedness vanishes. The proposition: out of nothing comes nothing, nothing is just nothing, owes its peculiar importance to its opposition to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>generally, and consequently also to its opposition to the creation of the world from nothing. Those who maintain the proposition: nothing is just nothing, and even grow heated in its defence, are unaware that in so doing they are subscribing to the abstract pantheism of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Eleatics,&nbsp;</em>and also in principle to that of Spinoza. The philosophical view for which &#39;being is only being, nothing is only nothing&#39;, is a valid principle, merits the name of &#39;system of identity&#39;; this abstract identity is the essence of pantheism.</p>

The same must be said of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and nothing</em>, as was said above about immediacy and mediation (which latter contains a reference to an other, and hence to<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation</em>), that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">nowhere in heaven or on earth is there anything which does not contain within itself both being and nothing</span>. Of course, since we are speaking here of a particular&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actual something</em>, those determinations are no longer present in it in the complete untruth in which they are as being and nothing; they are in a more developed determination, and are grasped, for example, as positive and negative, the former being posited, reflected being, the latter posited, reflected nothing; the positive contains as its abstract basis being, and the negative, nothing. Thus in God himself,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>(energy, creation, power, and so forth), essentially involves the determination of the negative-they are the producing of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>But an empirical elucidation by examples of the said assertion would be altogether superfluous here. Since the unity of being and nothing as the primary truth now forms once and for all the basis and element of all that follows, besides&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming itself,</em>&nbsp;all further logical determinations: determinate being, quality, and generally all philosophical Notions, are examples of this unity. But self-styled sound common sense, if it rejects the unseparatedness of being and nothing, may be set the task of trying to discover an example in which the one is found separated from the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(something from&nbsp;</em>limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or limitation,&nbsp;</em>or, as just mentioned, the infinite, God, from energy or activity). Only the empty figments of thought, being and nothing themselves are these separated things and it is these that are preferred by &#39;sound common sense&#39; to the truth, to the unseparatedness of both which is everywhere before us.</p>

Only a few of them can be mentioned.

This inference from, or application of, the proposition completely alters its meaning. The proposition contains the pure abstractions of being and nothing; but the application converts them into a determinate being and a determinate nothing. But as we have said, the question here is not of determinate being.&nbsp;<a name="HL1_86"></a>A determinate, a finite, being is one that is in relation to another; it is a content standing in a necessary relation to another content, to the whole world. As regards the reciprocally determining context of the whole, metaphysics could make the &mdash; at bottom tautological &mdash; assertion that if a speck of dust were destroyed the whole universe would collapse. In the instances against the proposition in question something appears as not indifferent to whether it is or is not, not on account of being or non-being, but on account of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>which brings it into relation with something else. If a specific content, any determinate being, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed,&nbsp;</em>then because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>, it is in a manifold relationship with another content; it is not a matter of indifference to it whether a certain other content with which it is in relation is, or is not; for it is only through such relation that it essentially is what it is. The same is the case in the ordinary way of thinking (taking non-being in the more specific sense of such way of thinking as contrasted with actuality) in the context of which the being or the absence of a content, which, as determinate, is conceived as in relation to another, is not a matter of indifference.</p>

As we know, there was presupposed in that so-called proof the concept of a being possessing all realities, including therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence,&nbsp;</em>which was likewise assumed as one of the realities. The main thesis of the Kantian criticism was that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>or being (these being taken here as synonymous) is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">property&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real predicate,&nbsp;</em>that is to say, is not a concept of something which could be added to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept</em>&nbsp;of a thing. By this Kant means to say that being is not a determination of the content of a thing.&#39; Therefore, he goes on to say, the possible does not contain more than the actual; a hundred actual dollars do not contain a whit more than a hundred possible ones; that is, the content of the former has no other determination than has the content of the latter. If this content is considered as isolated, it is indeed a matter of indifference whether it is, or is not; it contains no distinction of being or non-being, this difference does not affect it at all. The hundred dollars do not diminish if they do not exist, or increase if they do. A difference must come only from elsewhere. &#39;On the other hand,&#39; Kant reminds us, &#39;my fortune benefits more from a hundred actual dollars than from the mere concept of them or from their possibility. For in actuality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the object&nbsp;</em>is not merely contained analytically in my concept, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">added synthetically to my concept&nbsp;</em>(which is a determination of my state), although the hundred dollars in my thought are not themselves increased one whit by this being which they have apart from my concept.&#39;</p>

For the one as for the other, my fortune and the figurate conception, a hundred dollars are a determination of a content or, as Kant expresses it, &#39;they are added to such a concept synthetically&#39;; I as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possessor&nbsp;</em>of a hundred dollars or as not possessing them, or even I as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">imagining&nbsp;</em>or not imagining them, is of course a different content. Stated more generally: the abstractions of being and nothing both cease to be abstractions if they acquire a determinate content; being is then reality, the determinate being of a hundred dollars; nothing is the negation, the determinate non-being of them. This determinate content itself, the hundred dollars, also grasped isolatedly in abstraction is unchanged the same in the one as it is in the other. But since, furthermore, being is taken as a state of my fortune, the hundred dollars stand in relation to this state, as regards which the determinateness which they are is not a matter of indifference; their being or non-being is only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration;&nbsp;</em>they are transposed into the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being.&nbsp;</em>When, therefore, it is urged against the unity of being and nothing that it is nevertheless not a matter of indifference whether anything (the hundred dollars) is, or is not, we practise the deception of converting the difference between whether I&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">have or have not&nbsp;</em>the hundred dollars into a difference between being and non-being-a deception based, as we have shown, on the one-sided abstraction which ignores the determinate being present in such examples and holds fast merely to being and non-being, just as, conversely, the abstract being and nothing which should be apprehended is transformed into a definite being and nothing, into a determinate being.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Determinate being&nbsp;</em>is the first category to contain the real difference of being and nothing, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something and other.&nbsp;</em>It is this real difference which is vaguely present in ordinary thinking, instead of abstract being and pure nothing and their only imagined difference.</p>

But this so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept&nbsp;</em>of the hundred dollars is a spurious concept; the form of simple self-relation does not belong to such a limited, finite content itself; it is a borrowed form attached to it by the subjective understanding; the being of the hundred dollars is not self-related but alterable and perishable.</p>

This criticism, through its popular example, has made itself universally plausible: who does not know that a hundred actual dollars are different from a hundred merely possible ones? that they make a difference to the state of my fortune? Because this difference is so obvious with the hundred dollars, therefore the concept, that is, the specific nature of the content as an empty possibility, and being, are different from each other;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore&nbsp;</em>the Notion of God too is different from his being, and just as little as I can extract from the possibility of the hundred dollars their actuality, just as little can I extract from the Notion of God his existence; but the onotological proof is supposed to consist of this extraction of the existence of God from his Notion. Now though it is of course true that Notion is different from being, there is a still greater difference between God and the hundred dollars and other finite things. It is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">definition of finite things&nbsp;</em>that in them the Notion is different from being, that Notion and reality, soul and body, are separable and hence that they are perishable and mortal; the abstract definition of God, on the other hand, is precisely that his Notion and his being are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unseparated and inseparable.&nbsp;</em>The genuine criticism of the categories and of reason is just this: to make intellect aware of this difference and to prevent it from applying to God the determinations and relationships of the finite.</p>

The emphasis is laid chiefly on their being one and the same, as in judgments generally, where it is the predicate that first states what the subject is. Consequently, the sense seems to be that the difference is denied, although at the same time it appears directly in the proposition; for this enunciates both determinations, being and nothing, and contains them as distinguished. At the same time, the intention cannot be that abstraction should be made from them and only the unity retained. Such a meaning would self-evidently be one-sided, because that from which abstraction is to be made is equally present and named in the proposition. Now in so far as the proposition: being and nothing are the same, asserts the identity of these determinations, but, in fact, equally contains them both as distinguished, the proposition is self-contradictory and cancels itself out. Bearing this in mind and looking at the proposition more closely, we find that it has a movement which involves the spontaneous vanishing of the proposition itself. But in thus vanishing, there takes place in it that which is to constitute its own peculiar content, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming.</em></p>

In this connection we must, at the outset, make this general observation, namely, that the proposition in the form&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of a judgment&nbsp;</em>is not suited to express speculative truths; a familiarity with this fact is likely to remove many misunderstandings of speculative truths. Judgment is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical&nbsp;</em>relation between subject and predicate; in it we abstract from the fact that the subject has a number of determinatenesses other than that of the predicate, and also that the predicate is more extensive than the subject. Now if the content is speculative, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-identical&nbsp;</em>aspect of subject and predicate is also an essential moment, but in the judgment this is not expressed. It is the form of simple judgment, when it is used to express speculative results, which is very often responsible for the paradoxical and bizarre light in which much of recent philosophy appears to those who are not familiar with speculative thought.</p>

But thus there arises the further defect that these propositions are not connected, and therefore exhibit their content only in the form of an antinomy whereas their content refers to one and the same thing, and the determinations which are expressed in the two propositions are supposed to be in complete union-a union which can only be stated as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unrest of incompatibles,&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement.&nbsp;</em>The commonest injustice done to a speculative content is to make it one-sided, that is, to give prominence only to one of the propositions into which it can be resolved. It cannot then be denied that this proposition is asserted;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but the statement is just as false as it is true,&nbsp;</em>for once one of the propositions is taken out of the speculative content, the other must at least be equally considered and stated. Particular mention must be made here of that, so to speak, unfortunate word, &#39;unity&#39;. Unity, even more than identity, expresses a subjective reflection; it is taken especially as the relation which arises from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparison,</em>from external reflection. When this reflection finds the same thing in two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different objects,</em>&nbsp;the resultant unity is such that there is presupposed the complete&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>to it of the objects themselves which are compared, so that this comparing and unity does not concern the objects themselves and is a procedure and a determining external to them. Unity, therefore, expresses wholly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>sameness and sounds all the more blatantly paradoxical the more the terms of which it is asserted show themselves to be sheer opposites. So far then, it would be better to, say only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unseparatedness and inseparability,</em>&nbsp;but then the affirmative aspect of the relation of the whole would not find expression.</p>

Their difference is therefore completely empty, each of them is in the same way indeterminate; the difference, then, exists not in themselves but in a third, in subjective opinion.

Without having satisfied this first requirement of the ancient science whose logical rules they accept as valid and apply in other cases, all that they maintain about being and nothing amounts only to assertions which are scientifically worthless. If elsewhere it has been said that existence, in so far as this at first is held to be synonymous with being, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complement to possibility,&nbsp;</em>then this presupposes another determination, possibility, and so being is not enunciated in its immediacy, but in fact as not self-subsistent, as conditioned.

But, as a matter of fact, if this very seeing is more exactly imagined, one can readily perceive that in absolute clearness there is seen just as much, and as little, as in absolute darkness, that the one seeing is as good as the other, that pure seeing is a seeing of nothing. Pure light and pure darkness are two voids which are the same thing. Something can be distinguished only in determinate light or darkness (light is determined by darkness and so is darkened light, and darkness is determined by light, is illuminated darkness), and for this reason, that it is only darkened light and illuminated darkness which have within themselves the moment of difference and are, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>being.</p>

Now wherever and in whatever form being and nothing are in question, this third must be present; for the two terms have no separate subsistence of their own but are only in becoming, in this third. But this third has many empirical shapes, which are set aside or ignored by abstraction in order to hold fast, each by itself, these its products, being and nothing, and to show them protected against transition. Such simple procedure of abstraction can be countered, equally simply, by calling to mind the empirical existence in which that abstraction is itself only a something having a determinate being. Or else it is some other form of reflection which is supposed to effect the separation of what is inseparable. Such determination carries within itself its own opposite, and, without referring back and appealing to the nature of the thing itself, the determination of reflection can be refuted in its own self by taking it just as it presents itself and pointing out in it its own other. It would be favour in vain to attempt to intercept all the shifts and turns of reflection and its arguments in order to cut off and render impossible to it all the evasions and digressions by which it conceals from itself its own self-contradiction. For this reason I, too, refrain from taking notice of many of the so-called objections and refutations which have been advanced against the proposition that neither being nor nothing truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>but that their truth is only becoming. The intellectual training which alone can afford an insight into the nullity of such refutations, or rather spontaneously dispell such random fancies, is effected only by a critical knowledge of the forms of the understanding; but those who are most prolific with such objections straightway launch their reflections against the first propositions without first acquiring or having acquired, by a further study of logic, an awareness of the nature of these crude reflections.</p>

As thus taken, entirely on its own, being is indeterminate, and has therefore no relation to an other; consequently, it seems that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">from this beginning&nbsp;</em>no further&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">progress&nbsp;</em>can be made &mdash; that is, from this beginning itself &mdash; and that progress can only be achieved by linking it on to something extraneous, something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside it.&nbsp;</em>Hence the progress made in affirming that being is the same as nothing appears as a second, absolute beginning-a transition which is independent of being and added to it from outside. If being had a determinateness, then it would not be the absolute beginning at all; it would then depend on an other and would not be immediate, would not be the beginning. But if it is indeterminate and hence a genuine beginning, then, too, it has nothing with which it could bridge the gap between itself and an other; it is at the same time the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end.&nbsp;</em>It is just as impossible for anything to break forth from it as to break into it;&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">with Parmenides as with Spinoza, there is no progress from being ot absolute substance to the negative, to the finite</span>. If, nevertheless, there is progress &mdash; which as has been remarked, in the case of relationless, and so progress-less being can be accomplished only in an external manner-then this progress is a second, a fresh beginning. Thus Fichte&#39;s absolutely primary, unconditioned principle: A = A, is thesis; the second is antithesis. This latter is supposed to be partly conditioned, partly unconditioned (and so an internal contradiction). This is a progress by external reflection which, having negated the absolute with which it began-the antithesis is the negation of the first identity-straightway expressly converts its second&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned&nbsp;</em>into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditioned.&nbsp;</em>But if there were any justification at all for the progress, that is, for sublating the first beginning, then this first would itself have to be of such a nature that an other could connect itself with it; and therefore it would have to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate.&nbsp;</em>But neither&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>nor even absolute substance, claims to be such: on the contrary.

He states the problem thus: that there be demonstrated the originating or producing of a synthesis in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure&nbsp;</em>[unity], whether of consciousness, of space, or of time. &ldquo;Let space be one, time be one, consciousness be one ... Now tell me how does any one of these three ones&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">purely&nbsp;</em>make itself into a manifold within itself ... each is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">no other;&nbsp;</em>a one and the same sort, a self-sameness without any distinction of one from the other; for these distinctions still slumber in the empty infinitude of the indeterminate from which each and everything determinate has yet to proceed! What brings&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finitude&nbsp;</em>into those three infinities? What impregnates space and time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori&nbsp;</em>with number and measure and transforms them into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure manifold?&nbsp;</em>What brings&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure spontaneity&nbsp;</em>(ego) into oscillation? Whence does its pure vowel get its consonant, or rather how does its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">soundless, uninterrupted&nbsp;</em>sounding interrupt itself and break off in order to gain at least a kind of &#39;self-sound&#39; (vowel), an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">accent</em>?&rdquo; It is evident that Jacobi recognised very clearly the insubstantial nature, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non ens,&nbsp;</em>of abstraction, whether so-called absolute (i.e. only abstract) space, or abstract time, or abstract pure consciousness, the ego; he remains fixed in such abstraction in order to maintain the impossibility of a transition to an other (the condition of a synthesis), and to the synthesis itself. The synthesis, which is the point of interest, must not be taken as a connection of determinations already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>there; the question is partly of the genesis of a second to a first, of a determinate to an indeterminate first principle, partly, however,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of immanent&nbsp;</em>synthesis, synthesis&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori &mdash; a&nbsp;</em>self-subsistent, self-determined unity of distinct moments.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Becoming&nbsp;</em>is this immanent synthesis of being and nothing; but because synthesis suggests more than anything else the sense of an external bringing together of mutually external things already there, the name synthesis, synthetic unity, has rightly been dropped. Jacobi asks how does the pure vowel of the ego get its consonant, what brings determinateness into indeterminateness? The what would be easy to answer and has been answered by Kant in his own manner; but the question how means: in what peculiar manner, in what relationship, and so forth, and thus demands the statement of a particular category; but there can be no question here of a peculiar manner, of categories of the understanding. The very question how itself belongs to the bad habits of reflection, which demands comprehensibility, but at the same time presupposes its own fixed categories and consequently knows beforehand that it is armed against the answering of its own question. Neither has it with Jacobi the higher sense of a question concerning the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity&nbsp;</em>of the synthesis; for he remains, as has been said, fixed in the abstractions in order to maintain the impossibility of the synthesis. Especially graphic is his description of the procedure for reaching the abstraction of space. &lsquo;For a time I must try clean to forget that I ever saw, heard, touched or handled anything at all, myself expressly not excepted. Clean, clean, clean must I forget all movement, and precisely this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">forgetting,&nbsp;</em>because it is hardest, I must make my greatest concern. just as I have thought away everything in general, so I must also completely and entirely get rid of it, retaining nothing but the forcibly arrested intuition alone of infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immutable space.&nbsp;</em>I may not therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">again think into it&nbsp;</em>my own self as something distinct from it and yet connected with it; I may not let myself be merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surrounded and pervaded</em>&nbsp;by it: but I must wholly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pass over&nbsp;</em>into it, become one with it, transform myself into it; I must leave nothing over of myself but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this my intuition&nbsp;</em>itself, in order to contemplate it as a genuinely self-subsistent, independent, single and sole conception.&rsquo;</p>

The Kantian&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori&nbsp;</em>synthesis of self-consciousness, that is, the function of this unity to differentiate itself and in this differentiation to preserve itself, is attenuated by Jacobi into the same abstraction. That &lsquo;synthesis&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&rsquo;,&nbsp;</em>the &lsquo;original act of judgment&rsquo;, he converts one-sidedly into &lsquo;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">copula in itself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; an &quot;is, is, is&quot;, without beginning or end and without what, who or which. This repetition of repetition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ad infinitum&nbsp;</em>is the sole business, function and product of the absolutely pure synthesis; it is itself empty, pure, absolute repetition itself.&rsquo; Though, in fact, since there is no breaking off, that is, no negation or distinguishing in it, it is not a repetition but merely undifferentiated, simple being. But, then, is this still a synthesis if Jacobi omits precisely that which makes the unity a synthetic unity?</p>

The empirical<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transition,&nbsp;</em>moreover, is self-evident; consciousness can of course make empty space, empty time, and even empty consciousness itself or pure being, its object and content, but it does not stop at that; it goes beyond it or rather presses forward out of such a vacuity to a better content, that is, to a content which in some way or other is more concrete, and which to that extent is better and truer however bad it may be in other respects; just such a content is in general synthetic, this word being taken in its more general sense. Thus Parmenides has to reckon with illusion and opinion, the opposite of being and truth; Spinoza likewise, with attributes, modes, extension, movement, understanding, will, and so on. The synthesis contains and demonstrates the falsity of those abstractions; in it they are in unity with their other, not, therefore, as independently self-subsistent, not as absolute, but purely as relative.</p>

Consciousness by making abstraction can, of course, fill itself with such indeterminates also and the abstractions thus held fast are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thoughts&nbsp;</em>of pure space, pure time, pure consciousness, or pure being. It is the thought of pure space, etc. &mdash; that is, pure space, etc.,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own&nbsp;</em>self &mdash; that is to be demonstrated as null: that it is as such already its own opposite, that its opposite has already penetrated into it, that it is already by itself the accomplished coming-forth-from-itself, a determinateness.</p>

They are, as Jacobi profusely describes them, results of abstraction; they are expressly determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate&nbsp;</em>and this &mdash; to go back to its simplest form &mdash; is being. But it is this very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminateness&nbsp;</em>which constitutes its determinateness; for indeterminateness is opposed to determinateness; hence as so opposed it is itself determinate or the negative, and the pure, quite abstract negative. It is this indeterminateness or abstract negation which thus has being present within it, which reflection, both outer and inner, enunciates when it equates it with nothing, declares it to be an empty product of thought, to be nothing. Or it can be expressed thus: because being is devoid of all determination whatsoever, it is not the (affirmative) determinateness which it is; it is not being but nothing.</p>

But, it may be continued, the beginning is thus not an affirmative, not being, but just nothing, and nothing is then also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end,&nbsp;</em>at least as much as immediate being, and even more so. The shortest way is to let such reasoning take its course and then wait and see what is the nature of its boasted results. That&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing&nbsp;</em>would be the result of such reasoning and that now the beginning should be made with nothing (as in Chinese philosophy), need not cause us to lift a finger, for before we could do so this nothing would no less have converted itself into being (see Section B above). But further, this abstraction from everything (which &#39;everything&#39; nevertheless is an affirmative being) having been presupposed, then it must be understood more exactly; the result of making abstraction from all that is, is first of all abstract being,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>&nbsp;as such; just as in the cosmological proof of the existence of God from the contingent being of the world, in which proof we rise above such contingent being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is still taken up with us in our ascent and is determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite being.&nbsp;</em>Of course, one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can&nbsp;</em>also abstract from this pure being, being can be thrown in with the all from which abstraction has already been made; then nothing remains. Now if we want to forget the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking of nothing,</em>&nbsp;that is, its conversion into being, or are ignorant of it, we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can</em>&nbsp;proceed in the style of &#39;one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can&#39;;&nbsp;</em>we can for example (God be praised!) also abstract from nothing (for the creation of the world, too, is an abstraction from nothing), and then what remains is not nothing, for it is just from this that we have made abstraction; we have in fact arrived at being again. This, &#39;one can&#39;, gives an external play of abstraction, in which the abstracting itself is only the one-sided activity of the negative. It is directly implied in this very form of &#39;one can&#39;, that for it being is just as indifferent as nothing, and that with the vanishing of either of them there is equally an arising of the other; but it is equally a matter of indifference whether one starts from the doing of nothing, or from nothing; for the former, that is the mere abstracting, has neither more nor less of truth in it than mere nothing has.</p>

After removing from the One the various determinations of whole and parts, of being-within-itself, of being-in-another, etc., of shape, time, etc., he reaches the result that being does not belong to the One, for being belongs to any particular something only in one of these modes. Plato next deals with the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the One is,&nbsp;</em>and we should refer to Plato himself to see how, starting from this proposition, he accomplishes the transition to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being</em>&nbsp;of the One.

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">But when the presence of nothing in a determinate being is thus demonstrated, there still lingers on the thought of this difference of it from being, namely that the determinate being of nothing does not at all pertain to nothing itself, that nothing does not possess an independent being of its own, is not being as such. Nothing, it is said, is only the absence of being, darkness thus only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absence&nbsp;</em>of light, cold only absence of heat, and so on. And darkness only has meaning in relation to the eye, in external comparison with the positive factor, light, and similarly cold is only something in our sensation; on the other hand, light and heat, like being, are objective, active realities on their own account, and are of quite another quality and dignity than this negative, than nothing. One can often find it put forward as a weighty reflection and an important piece of information that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">darkness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only the absence</em>&nbsp;of light</span>, cold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only absence</em>of heat. About this acute reflection in this field of empirical objects, it can be observed that darkness does in fact show itself active in light, determining it to colour and thereby imparting visibility to it, since, as was said above,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">just as little is seen in pure light as in pure darkness</span>. Visibility, however, is effected in the eye, and the supposed negative has just as much a share in this as the light which is credited with being the real, positive factor; similarly, cold makes its presence known in water, in our sensations etc., and if we deny it so-called objective reality it is not a whit the worse for our doing so. But a further objection would be that here, too, as before, it is a negative with a determinate content that is spoken of, the argument is not confined to pure nothing, to which being, regarded as an empty abstraction, is neither inferior nor superior. But cold, darkness, and similar determinate negations are to be taken directly as they are by themselves and we shall then see what we have thereby effected in respect of their universal determination which has led them to be introduced here. They are supposed to be not just nothing but the nothing of light, heat, etc., of something determinate, of a content; thus they are a determinate, a contentful, nothing if one may so speak. But, as will subsequently appear, a determinateness is itself a negation, and so they are negative nothings; but a negative nothing is an affirmative something. The conversion of nothing through its determinateness (which previously appeared as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>being in a subject thinker, or in some other form) into an affirmative, appears to the consciousness which is fixed in the abstraction of the understanding as the acme of paradox; the insight that the negation of the negation is something positive, simple as it is, or rather because of its very simplicity, appears as a triviality to which haughty understanding need pay no heed, although the correctness of the insight is admitted-and the insight is not only correct, but, because of the universality of such determinations, it has its infinite extension and universal application, so that it were indeed well to pay attention to it.</p>

It is immediate and quite abstract because the transient moments are themselves abstract, that is, because the determinateness of either moment by means of which they passed over into each other is not yet posited in the other; nothing is not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in being, although it is true that being is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentially</em>&nbsp;nothing, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa.&nbsp;</em>It is therefore inadmissible to employ more developed forms of mediation here and to hold being and nothing in any kind of relationship-the transition in question is not yet a relation. Thus is it impermissible to say: nothing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of being, or being is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of nothing or nothing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of being, and so forth; or, transition into nothing can only occur&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">under the condition&nbsp;</em>that something is, or into being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">under the condition&nbsp;</em>of non-being. The kind of connection cannot be further determined without the connected&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>being further determined at the same time. The connection of ground and consequent, etc., has no longer merely being and nothing as the sides which it connects, but expressly being which is a ground, and something which, although merely posited and not self-subsistent, is yet not the abstract nothing.</p>

The Kantian antinomy relative to the finitude or infinity of the world in space and time will be considered more closely under the Notion of quantitative infinity. This simple, ordinary dialectic rests on holding fast to the opposition of being and nothing. It is proved in the following manner that a beginning of the world, or of anything, is impossible:</p>

If the world, or anything, is supposed to have begun, then it must have begun in nothing, but in nothing &mdash; or nothing &mdash; is no beginning; for a beginning includes within itself a being, but nothing does not contain any being. Nothing is only nothing. In a ground, a cause, and so on, if nothing is so determined, there is contained an affirmation, a being. For the same reason, too, something cannot cease to be; for then being would have to contain nothing, but being is only being, not the contrary of itself.</p>

What is sublated is not thereby reduced to nothing. Nothing is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>; what is sublated, on the other hand, is the result of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation</em>; it is a non-being but as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">result</em>&nbsp;which had its origin in a being. It still has, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate from which it originates</em>.</p>

But it is certainly remarkable to find that a language has come to use one and the same word for two opposite meanings. It is a delight to speculative thought to find in the language words which have in themselves a speculative meaning; the German language has a number of such. The double meaning of the Latin&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tollere&nbsp;</em>(which has become famous through the Ciceronian pun:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tollendum est Octavium</em>) does not go so far; its affirmative determination signifies only a lifting-up. Something is sublated only in so far as it has entered into unity with its opposite; in this more particular signification as something reflected, it may fittingly be called a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment.&nbsp;</em>In the case of the lever, weight and distance from a point are called its mechanical moments on account of the sameness of their effect, in spite of the contrast otherwise between something real, such as a weight, and something ideal, such as a mere spatial determination, a line.&#39; We shall often have occasion to notice that the technical language of philosophy employs Latin terms for reflected determinations, either because the mother tongue has no words for them or if it has, as here, because its expression calls to mind more what is immediate, whereas the foreign language suggests more what is reflected.</p>

Being is being, and nothing is nothing, only in their contradistinction from each other; but in their truth, in their unity, they have vanished as these determinations and are now something else. Being and nothing are the same;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but just because they are the same they are no longer being and nothing,&nbsp;</em>but now have a different significance. In becoming they were coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be; in determinate being, a differently determined unity, they are again differently determined moments. This unity now remains their base from which they do not again emerge in the abstract significance of being and nothing.</p>

To draw attention to a determinateness of the latter kind can only serve to elucidate or indicate in advance the course which will be exhibited in the development itself. That the whole, the unity of being and nothing, is in the one-sided determinateness of being is an external reflection; but in the negation, in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>and so on, it will come to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>It was necessary here to draw attention to the distinction referred to; but to take account of all the Remarks which may be prompted by reflection would lead to the prolixity of anticipating what must yield itself in the subject matter. Such reflections may facilitate a general view and thereby an understanding of the development, but they also have the disadvantage of appearing as unjustified assertions, grounds and foundations for what is to follow. They should therefore not be taken for more than they are supposed to be and should be distinguished from what is a moment in the development of the subject matter itself.</p>

In philosophy one may perhaps speak of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely empirical&nbsp;</em>reality as of a worthless existence. But when it is said that thoughts, concepts, theories&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">have no reality,&nbsp;</em>this means that they do not possess&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality; in itself&nbsp;</em>or in its notion, the idea of a Platonic Republic, for example, may well be true. Here the worth of the idea is not denied and it is left its place&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>the reality. But as against mere ideas,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere</em>notions, the real alone counts as true. The sense in which, on the one hand, outer existence is made the criterion of the truth of a content is no less one-sided than when the idea, essential being, or even inner feeling is represented as indifferent to outer existence and is even held to be the more excellent the more remote it is from reality.</p>

God was defined as the sum-total of all realities, and of this sum-total it was said that no contradiction was contained in it, that none of the realities cancelled any other; for a reality is to be taken only as a perfection, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative&nbsp;</em>being which contains no negation. Hence the realities are not opposed to one another and do not contradict one another.</p>

Reality is quality, determinate being; consequently, it contains the moment of the negative and is through this alone the determinate being that it is. Reality, taken as we are supposed to take it, in the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">eminent sense&nbsp;</em>or as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite</em>&nbsp;-in the usual meaning of the word-is expanded into indeterminateness and loses its meaning. God&#39;s goodness is not to be goodness in the ordinary, but in the eminent sense; not different from justice but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tempered&nbsp;</em>by it (a mediatory expression used by Leibniz), just as, conversely, justice is tempered by goodness; and so goodness is no longer goodness, nor justice any more justice. Power is supposed to be tempered by wisdom, but in that case it is not power as such for it would be subject to wisdom; wisdom is supposed to be expanded into power, in which case it vanishes as the wisdom which determines the end and measure of things. The true Notion of the infinite and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute</em>unity which will present itself later, is not to be understood as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tempering, a reciprocal restricting&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mixing;&nbsp;</em>such a superficial conception of the relationship leaves it indefinite and nebulous and can satisfy only a Notion-less way of thinking. When reality, taken as a determinate quality as it is in the said definition of God, is extended beyond its determinateness it ceases to be reality and becomes abstract being; God as the pure reality in all realities, or as the sum total of all realities, is just as devoid of determinateness and content as the empty absolute in which all is one.</p>

The said reality in all realities, the being in all determinate being, which is supposed to express the concept of God, is nothing else than abstract being, which is the same as nothing.</p>

According to Spinoza&#39;s definition, of which more subsequently, the infinity of anything is its affirmation. He grasped them therefore as attributes, that is, as not having a separate existence, a self-subsistent being of their own, but only as sublated, as moments; or rather, since substance in its own self lacks any determination whatever, they are for him not even moments, and the attributes like the modes are distinctions made by an external intellect. Similarly, the substantiality of individuals cannot persist in the face of that proposition. The individual is a relation-to-self through its setting limits to everything else; but these limits are thereby also limits of itself, relations to an other, it does not possess its determinate being within itself. True, the individual is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more&nbsp;</em>than merely an entity bounded on all sides, but this more belongs to another sphere of the Notion; in the metaphysics of being, the individual is simply a determinate something, and in opposition to the independence and self-subsistence of such something, to the finite as such, determinateness effectively brings into play its essentially negative character, dragging what is finite into that same negative movement of the understanding which makes everything vanish in the abstract unity of substance.</p>

Similarly, negation is determinate being, not the supposedly abstract nothing but posited here as it is in itself, as affirmatively present [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">als seiend</em>], belonging to the sphere of determinate being.

Determinate being, life, thought, and so on, essentially determine themselves to become a determinate being, a living creature, a thinker (ego) and so on. This determination is of supreme importance if we are not to remain at the stage of determinate being, life, thought, and so on &mdash; also the Godhead (instead of God) &mdash; as generalities. In our ordinary way of thinking,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>is rightly credited with reality. However, something is still a very superficial determination; just as reality and negation, determinate being and its determinateness, although no longer blank being and nothing, are still quite abstract determinations. It is for this reason that they are the most current expressions and the intellect which is philosophically untrained uses them most, casts its distinctions in their mould and fancies that in them it has something really well and truly determined. The negative of the negative is, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something,&nbsp;</em>only the beginning of the subject [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Subjekt</em>] &mdash; being-within-self, only as yet quite indeterminate. It determines itself further on, first, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a being-for-self&nbsp;</em>and so on, until in the Notion it first attains the concrete intensity of the subject. At the base of all these determinations lies the negative unity with itself. But in all this, care must be taken to distinguish between the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>negation as negation in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">general,&nbsp;</em>and the second negation, the negation of the negation: the latter is concrete,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute&nbsp;</em>negativity, just as the former on the contrary is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>negativity.</p>

It is immaterial which is first named and solely for that reason called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something;&nbsp;</em>(in Latin, when they both occur in a sentence, both are called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aliud,&nbsp;</em>or &#39;the one, the other&#39;,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alius alium;&nbsp;</em>when there is reciprocity the expression&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alter alterum&nbsp;</em>is analogous).

The entire determinateness falls into this external pointing out; even the expression &#39;this&#39; contains no distinction; each and every something is just as well a &#39;this&#39; as it is also an other. By &#39;this&#39; we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mean&nbsp;</em>to express something completely determined; it is overlooked that speech, as a work of the understanding, gives expression only to universals, except in the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">name&nbsp;</em>of a single object; but the individual name is meaningless, in the sense that it does not express a universal, and for the same reason appears as something merely posited and arbitrary; just as proper names, too, can be arbitrarily assumed, given or also altered.</p>

But in so doing it remains identical with itself, for that into which it alters is the other, and this is its sole determination; but what is altered is not determined in any different way but in the same way, namely, to be an other; in this latter, therefore, it only unites with its own self. It is thus posited as reflected into itself with sublation of the otherness, as a self-identical something from which, consequently, the otherness, which is at the same time a moment of it, is distinct from it and does not appertain to the something itself.</p>

This identity is already formally given in the sphere of determinate being, but more expressly in the consideration of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence&nbsp;</em>and of the relation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner and outer,&nbsp;</em>and most precisely in the consideration of the Idea as the unity of the Notion and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality</em>.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">People fancy that they are saying something lofty with the expression &#39;in itself&#39;, as they do in saying &#39;the inner&#39;; but what something is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only in itself</em>, is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it</em>; &#39;in itself&#39; is only an abstract, and so even external determination</span>.

On the other hand positive and negative, cause and effect, however much they may be taken as isolated from each other, are at the same time meaningless one without the other. There is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">present in them</em>their showing or reflection in each other, the showing or reflection in each of its other. In the different spheres of determination and especially in the progress of the exposition, or more precisely in the progress of the Notion towards the exposition of itself, it is of capital importance always clearly to distinguish what is still&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>and what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited, the</em>&nbsp;determinations as they are in the Notion, and as they are as posited, or as being-for-other. This is a distinction which belongs only to the dialectical development and which is unknown to metaphysical philosophising, which also includes the critical philosophy; the definitions of metaphysics, like its presuppositions, distinctions and conclusions, seek to assert and produce only what comes under the category of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>and that, too, of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself.</em></p>

But that which something has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in it,</em>&nbsp;is the middle term connecting them in this syllogism. Or, rather,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the being-in-the-something&nbsp;</em>showed itself as falling apart into these two extremes. The simple middle term is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>as such; to its identity belongs both determination and constitution. But determination spontaneously passes over into constitution, and the latter into the former. This is implied in what has been said already; the connection is more precisely this: in so far as that which something is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>is also present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in it,&nbsp;</em>it is burdened with being-for-other; hence the determination is, as such, open to relationship to other. The determinateness is at the same time a moment, but contains at the same time the qualitative distinction of being different from the in-itself, of being the negative of the something, another determinate being. The determinateness which thus holds the other within it, being united with the in-itself, brings the otherness into the latter or into the determination, which, consequently, is reduced to constitution. Conversely, being-for-other isolated as constitution and posited by itself, is in its own self the same as the other as such, the other in its own self, that is, the other of itself; but thus it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related&nbsp;</em>determinate being, the in-itself with a determinateness, and therefore a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination.&nbsp;</em>Consequently, in so far as determination and constitution are also to be held apart, the latter, which appears to be grounded in something external, in an other in general, also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">depends&nbsp;</em>on the former, and the determining from outside is at the same time determined by the something&#39;s own, immanent determination. But further, the constitution belongs to that which the something is in itself; something alters with its constitution.</p>

But the other is also qualitatively distinguished from this and is thus posited outside the something. The negation of its other is now the quality of the something, for it is as this sublating of its other that it is something. It is only in this sublation that the other is really opposed to another determinate being; the other is only externally opposed to the first something, or rather, since in fact they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">directly&nbsp;</em>connected, that is in their Notion, their connection is this, that determinate being has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed over&nbsp;</em>into otherness, something into other, and something is just as much an other as the other itself is. Now in so far as the being-within-self is the non-being of the otherness which is contained in it but which at the same time has a distinct being of its own, the something is itself the negation,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the ceasing of an other in it;&nbsp;</em>it is posited as relating itself negatively to the other and in so doing preserving itself; this other, the being-within-self of the something as negation of the negation, is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself,&nbsp;</em>and at the same time this sublation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is present in it&nbsp;</em>as a simple negation, namely, as its negation of the other something external to it. There is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single&nbsp;</em>determinateness of both, which on the one hand is identical with the being-within-self of the somethings as negation of the negation, and on the other hand, since these negations are opposed to one another as other somethings, conjoins and equally disjoins them through their own nature, each negating the other: this determinateness&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is limit.</em></p>

As such, it is not distinguished from its other; it is only determinate being and therefore has the same determination as its other; each is only a something in general, or each is an other; thus both are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the same.&nbsp;</em>But this their primarily immediate determinate being is now posited with the determinateness as limit, in which both are what they are, distinguished from each other. Limit is, however, equally their common distinguishedness, their unity and distinguishedness, like determinate being. This double identity of both, of determinate being and limit, contains this: that something has its determinate being only in the limit, and that since the limit and the determinate being are each at the same time the negative of each other, the something, which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in its limit, just as much separates itself from itself and points beyond itself to its non-being, declaring this is to be its being and thus passing over into it. To apply this to the preceding example and taking first the determination that something is what it is only in its limit: as thus determined, the point is therefore the limit of the line, not merely in the sense that the line only ceases in the point, and as a determinate being is outside it; neither is the line the limit of the plane merely in the sense that the plane only ceases in it-and similarly with surface as limit of the solid; on the contrary, in the point the line also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begins;&nbsp;</em>the point is its absolute beginning. Even when the line is represented as unlimited on either side, or, as it is put, is produced to infinity, the point still constitutes its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">element,&nbsp;</em>just as the line is the element of the plane, and the surface that of the solid. These limits are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle</em>&nbsp;of that which they limit; just as one, for example as hundredth, is the limit, but also the element, of the whole hundred.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">The other determination is the unrest of the something in its limit in which it is immanent, an unrest which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradiction</em>&nbsp;which impels the something out beyond itself. Thus the point is this dialectic of its own self to become a line, the line the dialectic to become a plane, and the plane the dialectic to become total space. A second definition is given of line, plane and total space: namely, that the line originates through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement&nbsp;</em>of the point, the plane through the movement of the line, and so on. But this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement&nbsp;</em>of the point, line and so on, is regarded as something contingent or as only thus imagined. This point of view is, however, really retracted in so far as the determinations from which the line and so on are supposed to originate are their elements and principles which, at the same time, are nothing else but their limits; and so the origin is not considered as contingent or as only thus imagined. That point, line and plane by themselves are self-contradictory, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginnings&nbsp;</em>which spontaneously repel themselves from themselves, so that the point, through its Notion, passes out of itself into the line,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moves in itself&nbsp;</em>and gives rise to the line, and so on, lies in the Notion of limit which is immanent in the something. The application itself, however, belongs to the consideration of space; to give an indication of it here, the point is the wholly abstract limit,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but in a determinate being;&nbsp;</em>this is taken as still wholly abstract, it is so-called absolute, that is, abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,&nbsp;</em>a purely continuous asunderness. But the limit is not abstract negation, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in this determinate being,&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial</em>determinateness; the point is, therefore, spatial, the contradiction of abstract negation and continuity, and is, therefore, the transition, the accomplished transition into the line, and so on; just as also, for the same reason,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is&nbsp;</em>no such thing as a point, line or plane.</p>

Because of this qualitative singleness of the negation, which has gone back to the abstract opposition of nothing and ceasing-to-be as opposed to being, finitude is the most stubborn category of the understanding; negation in general, constitution and limit, reconcile themselves with their other, with determinate being; and even nothing, taken abstractly as such, is given up as an abstraction; but finitude is the negation<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as fixed in itself,&nbsp;</em>and it therefore stands in abrupt contrast to its affirmative. The finite, it is true, lest itself be brought into flux, it is itself this, to be determined or destined to its end, but only to its end &mdash; or rather, it is the refusal to let itself be brought affirmatively to its affirmative, to the infinite, and to let itself be united with it; it is therefore posited as inseparable from its nothing, and is thereby cut off from all reconciliation with its other, the affirmative. The determination or destiny of finite things takes them no further than their<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end.&nbsp;</em>The understanding persists in this sadness of finitude by making non-being the determination of things and at the same time making it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">imperishable and absolute.&nbsp;</em>Their transitoriness could only pass away or perish in their other, in the affirmative; their finitude would then be parted from them; but it is their unalterable quality, that is, their quality which does not pass over into its other, that is, into its affirmative;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it is thus eternal</em></p>

But the point is, whether in thinking of the finite one holds fast to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of finitude and lets the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitoriness&nbsp;</em>continue to be, or whether the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitoriness</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ceasing-to-be cease to be.&nbsp;</em>But it is precisely in that view of the finite which makes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ceasing-to-be&nbsp;</em>the final determination of the finite, that this does not happen. It is the express assertion that the finite is irreconcilable with the infinite and cannot be united with it, that the finite is utterly opposed to the infinite. Being, absolute being, is ascribed to the infinite; confronting it, the finite thus remains held fast as its negative; incapable of union with the infinite, it remains absolute on its own side; from the affirmative, from the infinite, it would receive affirmation, and would thus cease to be; but a union with the infinite is just what is declared to be impossible. If it is not to remain fixed in its opposition to the infinite but is to cease to be, then, as we have already said, just this ceasing-to-be is its final determination, not the affirmative which would be only the ceasing to be of the ceasing-to-be. If, however, the finite is not to pass way in the affirmative, but its end is to be grasped as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>then we should be back again at that first, abstract nothing which itself has long since passed away.</p>

First of all, great stress is laid on the limitations of thought, of reason, and so on, and it is asserted that the limitation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cannot&nbsp;</em>be transcended. To make such as assertion is to be unaware that&nbsp;<a name="HL1_134aa"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">the very fact that something is determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended</span>. For a determinateness, a limit, is determined as a limitation only in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">free from the limitation;&nbsp;</em>the other of a limitation is precisely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being beyond&nbsp;</em>it. Stone and metal do not transcend their limitation because this is not a limitation for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">them.&nbsp;</em>If, however, in the case of such general propositions framed by the understanding, such as that limitation cannot be transcended, thought will not apply itself to finding out what is implied in the Notion, then it can be directed to the world of actuality where such proportions show themselves to be completely unreal. just because thought is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">supposed&nbsp;</em>to be superior to actuality, to dwell apart from it in higher regions and therefore to be itself determined as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought-to-be,&nbsp;</em>on the one hand, it does not advance to the Notion, and, on the other hand, it stands in just as untrue a relation to actuality as it does to the Notion.</p>

But even the stone, as a something, contains the distinction of its determination or in-itself and its determinate being, and to that extent it, too, transcends its limitation; the Notion which is implicit in it contains the identity of the stone with its other.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">If it is a base capable of being acted on by an acid, then it can be oxidised</span>, and neutralised, and so on. In oxidation, neutralisation and so on, it overcomes its limitation of existing only as a base; it transcends it, and similarly the acid overcomes its limitation of being an acid. This ought, the obligation to transcend limitations, is present in both acid and caustic base in such a degree that it is only by force that they can be kept fixed as (waterless, that is, purely non-neutral) acid and caustic base.</p>

The plant transcends the limitation of being a seed, similarly, of being blossom, fruit, leaf; the seed becomes the developed plant, the blossom fades away, and so on. The sentient creature, in the limitation of hunger, thirst, etc., is the urge to overcome this limitation and it does overcome it. It feels&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pain,</em>and it is the privilege of the sentient nature to feel pain; it is a negation in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self,&nbsp;</em>and the negation is determined as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limitation&nbsp;</em>in its feeling, just because the sentient creature has the feeling of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self,&nbsp;</em>which is the totality that transcends this determinateness.

Therefore, it has its place and its validity in the sphere of finitude where it holds fast to being-in-itself in opposition to limitedness, declaring the former to be the regulative and essential factor relatively to what is null. Duty is an ought directed against the particular will, against self-seeking desire and capricious interest and it is held up as an ought to the will in so far as this has the capacity to isolate itself from the true. Those who attach such importance to the ought of morality and fancy that morality is destroyed if the ought is not recognized as ultimate truth, and those too who, reasoning from the level of the understanding, derive a perpetual satisfaction from being able to confront everything there is with an ought, that is, with a &#39;knowing better&#39; &mdash; and for that very reason are just as loath to be robbed of the ought &mdash; do not see that as regards the finitude of their sphere the ought receives full recognition. But in the world of actuality itself, Reason and Law are not in such a bad way that they only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought&nbsp;</em>to be &mdash; it is only the abstraction of the in-itself that stops at this-any more than the ought is in its own self perennial and, what is the same thing, that finitude is absolute. The philosophy of Kant and Fichte sets up the ought as the highest point of the resolution of the contradictions of Reason; but the truth is that the ought is only the standpoint which clings to finitude and thus to contradiction.</p>

Their relation to each other is the finite itself which contains them both in its being-within-self. These moments of its determination are qualitatively opposed; limitation is determined as the negative of the ought and the ought likewise as the negative of limitation. The finite is thus inwardly self-contradictory; it sublates itself, ceases to be. But this its result, the negative as such, is [a] its very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination;&nbsp;</em>for it is the negative of the negative. Thus, in ceasing to be, the finite has not ceased to be; it has become in the first instance only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another&nbsp;</em>finite which, however, is equally a ceasing-to-be as transition into another finite, and so on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity.&nbsp;</em>But [b] closer consideration of this result shows that the finite in its ceasing-to-be, in this negation of itself has attained its being-in-itself, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">united with itself.&nbsp;</em>Each of its moments contains precisely this result; the ought transcends the limitation, that is, transcends itself; but beyond itself or its other, is only the limitation itself. The limitation, however, points directly beyond itself to its other, which is the ought; but this latter is the same duality of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself and determinate being</em>as the limitation; it is the same thing; in going beyond itself, therefore, it equally only unites with itself. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity with itself,&nbsp;</em>the negation of negation, is affirmative being and thus the other of the finite, of the finite which is supposed to have the first negation for its determinateness; this other is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite.</em></p>

In infinity we have the satisfaction that all determinateness, alteration, all limitation and with it the ought itself, are posited as vanished, as sublated, that the nothing of the finite is posited. As this negation of the finite the in-itself is determinate and thus, as negation of the negation, is affirmative within itself. But this affirmation as qualitative, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;self-relation, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being;&nbsp;</em>and thus the infinite is reduced to the category of a being which has the finite confronting it as an other; its negative nature is posited as the s imply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative,&nbsp;</em>hence as the first and immediate negation. The infinite is in this way burdened with the opposition to the finite which, as an other, remains at the same time a determinate reality although in its in-itself, in the infinite, it is at the same time posited as sublated; this infinite is the non-finite-a being in the determinateness of negation. Contrasted with the finite, with the sphere of affirmative determinatenesses, of realities, the infinite is the indeterminate void, the beyond of the finite, whose being-in-itself is not present in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>reality.</p>

The finite is real determinate being which persists as such even when transition is made to its non-being, to the infinite; this, as has been shown, has only the first, immediate negation for its determinateness relatively to the finite, just as the finite as opposed to that negation has, as negated, only the significance of an other and is, therefore, still [only]&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something.&nbsp;</em>When, therefore, the understanding, raising itself above this finite world, ascends to its highest, to the infinite, this finite world remains for it on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this side,</em>&nbsp;so that the infinite is only set&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">above or beyond&nbsp;</em>the finite, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separated</em>&nbsp;from it, with the consequence that the finite is separated from the infinite; each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assigned a distinct&nbsp;</em>place &mdash; the finite as determinate being here, on<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>side, and the infinite, although the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself</em>&nbsp;of the finite, nevertheless as a beyond in the dim, inaccessible distance,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>of which the finite is and remains.</p>

This negation which connects them &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">somethings&nbsp;</em>reflected into themselves &mdash; is the limit of the one relatively to the other, and that, too, in such a manner that each of them does not have the limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in it&nbsp;</em>merely relatively to the other, but the negation is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself</em>; the limit is thus present in each on its own account, in separation from the other. But the limit is in the form of the first negation and thus both are limited, finite in themselves. However, each as affirmatively self-related is also the negation of its limit; each thus immediately repels the limit, as its non-being, from itself and, as qualitatively separated from it, posits it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another being&nbsp;</em>outside it, the finite positing its non-being as this infinite and the infinite, similarly, the finite. It is readily conceded that there is a necessary transition from the finite to the infinite &mdash; necessary through the determination of the finite &mdash; and that the finite is raised to the form of being-in-itself, since the finite, although persisting as a determinate being, is at the same time also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;nothing and therefore as destined to bring about its own dissolution; whereas the infinite, although determined as burdened with negation and limit, is at the same time also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possessing being-in-itself,&nbsp;</em>so that this abstraction of self-related affirmation constitutes its determination, and hence finite determinate being is not present in it. But it has been shown that the infinite itself attains affirmative being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by means of</em>negation, as the negation of negation, and that when this its affirmation is taken as merely simple, qualitative being, the negation contained in it is reduced to a simple immediate negation and thus to a determinateness and limit, which then, as in contradiction with the being-in-itself of the infinite is posited as excluded from it, as not belonging to it, as, on the contrary, opposed to its being-in-itself, as the finite. As therefore each is in its own self and through its own determination the positing of its other, they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inseparable.&nbsp;</em>But this their unity is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concealed&nbsp;</em>in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>otherness, it is the inner unity which only lies at their base.</p>

We pass from the finite to the infinite. This transcending of the finite appears as an external act. In this void beyond the finite, what arises? What is the positive element in it? Owing to the inseparability of the infinite and the finite &mdash; or because this infinite remaining aloof on its own side is itself limited &mdash; there arises a limit; the infinite has vanished and its other, the finite, has entered. But this entrance of the finite appears as a happening external to the infinite, and the new limit as something that does not arise from the infinite itself but is likewise found as given. And so we are faced with a relapse into the previous determination which has been sublated in vain. But this new limit is itself only something which has to be sublated or transcended. And so again there arises the void, the nothing, in which similarly the said determinateness, a new limit, is encountered &mdash; and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">so on to infinity.</em></p>

In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">each,&nbsp;</em>therefore, there lies the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness of the other,&nbsp;</em>although according to the standpoint of the infinite progress these two are supposed to be shut out from each other and only to follow each other alternately; neither can be posited and grasped without the other, the infinite not without the finite, nor the latter without the infinite. In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">saying&nbsp;</em>what the infinite is, namely the negation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite,&nbsp;</em>the latter is itself included in what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">said;&nbsp;</em>it cannot be dispensed with for the definition or determination of the infinite. One only needs to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">be aware of what one is saying&nbsp;</em>in order to find the determination of the finite in the infinite. As regards the finite, it is readily conceded that it is the null; but its very nullity is the infinity from which it is thus inseparable. In this way of conceiving them, each may seem to be taken in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>with its other. But if they are taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">devoid of connection&nbsp;</em>with each other so that they are only joined by &#39;and&#39;, then each confronts the other as self-subsistent, as in its own self only affirmatively present. Let us see how they are constituted when so taken. The infinite, in that case, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one of the two;&nbsp;</em>but as only one of the two it is itself finite, it is not the whole but only one side; it has its limit in what stands over against it; it is thus thefinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite.&nbsp;</em>There are present only two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finites.</em>It is precisely this holding of the infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">apart&nbsp;</em>from the finite, thus giving it a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one-sided&nbsp;</em>character, that constitutes its finitude and, therefore, its unity with the finite. The finite, on the other hand, characterized as independent of and apart from the infinite, is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-relation&nbsp;</em>in which its relativity, its dependence and transitoriness is removed; it is the same self-subsistence and affirmation which the infinite is supposed to be.</p>

Since now they must also be distinguished, each is, as has just been shown, in its own self the unity of both; thus we have two such unities. The common element, the unity of the two determinatenesses, as unity, posits them in the first place as negated, since each is supposed to be what it is in its distinction from the other; in their unity, therefore, they lose their qualitative nature-an important reflection for rebutting that idea of the unity which insists on holding fast to the infinite and finite in the quality they are supposed to have when taken in their separation from each other, a view which therefore sees in that unity only contradiction, but not also resolution of the contradiction through the negation of the qualitative determinateness of both; thus the unity of the infinite and finite, simple and general in the first instance, is falsified.</p>

Conversely, the finite is likewise held fast as not negated, although in itself it is null; so that in its union with the infinite it is exalted to what it is not and is thereby infinitised in opposition to its determination as finite, which instead of vanishing is perpetuated.</p>

According to this,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">the unity of the finite and infinite is not an external bringing together of them, nor an incongruous combination alien to their own nature in which there would be joined together determinations inherently separate and opposed, each having a simple affirmative being independent of the other and incompatible with it; but each is in its own self this unity, and this only as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublating&nbsp;</em>of its own self in which neither would have the advantage over the other of having an in-itself and an affirmative determinate being. As has already been shown, finitude&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as a transcending of itself; it therefore contains infinity, the other of itself</span>.&nbsp;</p>

The finite is not sublated by the infinite as by a power existing outside it; on the contrary, its infinity consists in sublating its own self.</p>

Secondly, they are posited one after the other as distinct, each as positive on its own account. We thus compare these two determinations in their separation, just as in our comparison &mdash; an external comparing &mdash; we have separated the two modes of considering the finite and the infinite: on the one hand in their connection, and on the other hand each on its own account. But the infinite progress expresses more than this; in it there is also posited the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>of terms which are also distinct from each other, although at first the connection is still only a transition and alternation; only a simple reflection on our part is needed to see what is in fact present.</p>

Starting from the finite, the limit is transcended, the finite negated. We now have its beyond, the infinite, but in this the limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arises&nbsp;</em>again; and so we have the transcending of the infinite. This double sublation, however, is partly only an external affair, an alternation of the moments, and partly it is not yet posited as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single unity;&nbsp;</em>the transcending of each moment starts independently, is a fresh act, so that the two processes fall apart. But in addition there is also present in the infinite progress their<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection.&nbsp;</em>First there is the finite, then this is transcended and this negative or beyond of the finite is the infinite, and then this negation is again transcended, so that there arises a new limit, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite&nbsp;</em>again. This is the complete, self-closing movement which has arrived at that which constituted the beginning; what arises is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>as that from which the movement&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">began</em>&nbsp;that is, the finite is restored; it has therefore united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself,&nbsp;</em>has in its beyond only found&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>again.</p>

In the infinite, the beyond of the limit, there arises only another limit which has the same fate, namely, that as finite it must be negated. Thus what is present again is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>infinite which had previously disappeared in the new limit; the infinite, therefore, through its sublating, through its transcending of the new limit, is not removed any further either from the finite-for the finite is only this, to pass over into the infinite-or from itself, for it has arrived&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at&nbsp;</em>its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own self.</em></p>

The reason why understanding is so antagonistic to the unity of the finite and infinite is simply that it presupposes the limitation and the finite, as well as the in-itself, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">perpetuated;</em>&nbsp;in doing so it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">overlooks&nbsp;</em>the negation of both which is actually present in the infinite progress, as also the fact that they occur therein only as moments of a whole and that they come on the scene only by means of their opposite, but essentially also by means of the sublation of their opposite.</p>

It is, however, a matter of complete indifference which is taken as the beginning; and thus the difference which occasioned the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">double&nbsp;</em>result disappears of itself. This is likewise explicit in the line &mdash; unending in both directions &mdash; of the infinite progress in which each of the moments presents itself in equal alternation, and it is quite immaterial what point is fixed on or which of the two is taken as the beginning. They are distinguished in it but each is equally only the moment of the other. Since both the finite and the infinite itself are moments of the progress they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">jointly or in common the finite,</em>and since they are equally together negated in it and in the result, this result as negation of the finitude of both is called with truth the infinite. Their difference is thus the double meaning which both have. The finite has the double meaning of being first, only the finite<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">over against the</em>&nbsp;infinite which stands opposed to it, and secondly, of being the finite and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at the same time&nbsp;</em>the infinite opposed to it. The infinite, too, has the double meaning of being one of these two moments &mdash; as such it is the spurious infinite &mdash; and also the infinite in which both, the infinite and its other, are only moments. The infinite, therefore, as now before us is, in fact, the process in which it is deposed to being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of its determinations, the opposite of the finite, and so to being itself only one of the finites, and then raising this its difference from itself into the affirmation of itself and through this mediation becoming the true infinite.</p>

It is, however, superfluous to repeat an earlier, more abstract category such as reality, in connection with the more concrete categories and to employ it for determinations which are more concrete than it is in its own self. Such repetition as to say that essence, or the Idea, is the real, has its origin in the fact that for untrained thinking, the most abstract categories such as being, determinate being, reality, finitude, are the most familiar.</p>

The negation is thus determined as ideality; ideal being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Ideelle</em>] is the finite as it is in the true infinite &mdash; as a determination, a content, which is distinct but is not an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">independent, self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>being, but only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment.</em></p>

With reference to reality and ideality, however, the opposition of finite and infinite is grasped in such a manner that the finite ranks as the real but the infinite as the &#39;ideal&#39; [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Ideelle</em>]; in the same way that further on the Notion, too, is regarded as an &#39;ideal&#39;, that is, as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere</em>&nbsp;&#39;ideal&#39;, in contrast to determinate being as such which is regarded as the real. When they are contrasted in this way, it is pointless to reserve the term &#39;ideal&#39; for the concrete determination of negation in question; in that opposition we return once more to the one-sidedness of the abstract negative which is characteristic of the spurious infinite, and perpetuate the affirmative determinate being of the finite.</p>

This infinite is a first elevation of sensuous conception above the finite into thought, the content of which, however, is only nothing, that is, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">expressly&nbsp;</em>in the form of not-being &mdash; a flight beyond limited being which does not inwardly collect itself and does not know how to bring the negative back to the positive. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomplete reflection&nbsp;</em>has completely before it both determinations of the genuine infinite: the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition&nbsp;</em>of the finite and infinite, and their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity</em>, but it does not bring these two thoughts together; the one inevitably evokes the other, but this reflection lets them only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alternate</em>.</p>

Thus, in the causal relation, cause and effect are inseparable; a cause which had no effect would not be a cause, just as an effect which had no cause would no longer be an effect. This relation yields, therefore, the infinite progress of causes and effects; something is determined as cause, but as finite (and it is finite for the very reason that it is separated from its effect) it, too, has a cause, that is, it is also an effect; hence the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same thing&nbsp;</em>that was determined as cause is also determined as effect &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of cause and effect; now that which is determined as effect again has a cause, that is, the cause has to be separated from its effect and posited as a different something; but this fresh cause is itself only an effect &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of cause and effect; it has an other for its cause &mdash; the separation of both determinations, and so on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity.</em></p>

The assertion is made: the finite and infinite are a single unity; this false assertion must be corrected by the opposite: they are absolutely different and opposed to each other; this must be corrected again by declaring that they are inseparable, that the determination of each lies in the other, by the assertion of their unity, and so on to infinity. What is required in order to see into the nature of the infinite is nothing difficult: it is to be aware that the infinite progress, the developed infinite of the understanding, is so constituted as to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alternation&nbsp;</em>of the two determinations, of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>and the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separation&nbsp;</em>of both moments and also to be aware that this unity and this separation are themselves inseparable.</p>

In it, also actually, there is present what was pointed out above: that the beyond of the finite is the infinite, but equally beyond the infinite again the finite finds itself reborn; consequently, in this process the finite is united only with itself, and the same is true of the infinite &mdash; so that the same negation of the negation results in an affirmation, this result thus proving itself to be their truth and primary determination. In this being which is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideality of</em>&nbsp;the distinct moments, the contradiction has not vanished abstractly, but is resolved and reconciled, and the thoughts are not only complete, but they are also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">brought together.&nbsp;</em>In this detailed example, there is revealed the specific nature of speculative thought, which consists solely in grasping the opposed moments in their unity. Each moment actually shows that it contains its opposite within itself and that in this opposite it is united with itself; thus the affirmative truth is this immanently active unity, the taking together of both thoughts, their infinity &mdash; the relation to self which is not immediate but infinite.</p>

Being, it is true, is itself the indeterminate; but that it is the opposite of determinate being, this is not directly expressed in it. In the infinite, on the other hand, this is expressed; it is the not-finite. The unity of the finite and infinite thus seems to be directly excluded, and that is why incomplete reflection is most stubbornly opposed to this unity.</p>

The answer, therefore, to the question: how does the infinite become finite? is this: that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is not&nbsp;</em>an infinite which is first of all infinite and only subsequently has need to become finite, to go forth into finitude; on the contrary, it is on its own account just as much finite as infinite. The question assumes that the infinite, on the one side, exists by itself, and that the finite which has gone forth from it into a separate existence &mdash; or from whatever source it might have come &mdash; is in its separation from the infinite truly real; but it should rather be said that this separation is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomprehensible.&nbsp;</em>Neither such a finite nor such an infinite has truth; and what is untrue is incomprehensible. But equally it must be said that they are comprehensible, to grasp them even as they are in ordinary conception, to see that in the one there lies the determination of the other, the simple insight into their inseparability, means to comprehend them;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this inseparability is their Notion.&nbsp;</em>But the separate self-subsistence of the said infinite and finite assumed in the question is an untrue content, and the question already implies an untrue connection between them. Instead, therefore, of answering the question, we must deny the false presuppositions contained in it, that is, the question itself. The question as to the truth of the said infinite and finite involves a change of standpoint and this change will cause a recoil upon the first question of the embarrassment it was intended to produce. This question of ours is something new for the reflection which is the source of the first question, since such reflection does not contain the speculative interest which, for its own sake and before it connects determinations, sets out to ascertain whether these, as presupposed, are something true. But in so far as the falsity of that abstract infinite, and of the finite which equally is supposed to remain standing on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its</em>&nbsp;side, is recognised, there is this to be said about the coming or going forth of the finite from the infinite: the infinite goes forth&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">out&nbsp;</em>of itself into finitude because, being grasped as an abstract unity, it has no truth, no enduring being within it; and conversely the finite goes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into&nbsp;</em>the infinite for the same reason, namely that it is a nullity. Or rather it should be said that the infinite has eternally gone forth into finitude, that, solely by itself and without having its other present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within it,&nbsp;</em>the infinite no more is than pure&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is.</p>

In this presupposition, the opposition which is insisted on merely has another form; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">differentiation&nbsp;</em>are separated and isolated from each other. But if the former is taken, not as the abstract indeterminate unity but, as it already is in the presupposition, as the determinate unity of the finite and the infinite, then the differentiation of both is already present in it too &mdash; a differentiation which is thus at the same time not a releasing of them into a separate self-subsistence, but which leaves them as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>moments in the unity. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of the finite and infinite and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinction</em>between them are just as inseparable as are finitude and infinity.</p>

The idealism of philosophy consists in nothing else than in recognising that the finite has no veritable being. Every philosophy is essentially an idealism or at least has idealism for its principle, and the question then is only how far this principle is actually carried out. This is as true of philosophy as of religion; for religion equally does not recognise finitude as a veritable being, as something ultimate and absolute or as something underived, uncreated, eternal. Consequently the opposition of idealistic and realistic philosophy has no significance. A philosophy which ascribed veritable, ultimate, absolute being to finite existence as such, would not deserve the name of philosophy; the principles of ancient or modern philosophies, water, or matter, or atoms are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thoughts,&nbsp;</em>universals, ideal entities, not things as they immediately present themselves to us, that is, in their sensuous individuality &mdash; not even the water of Thales. For although this is also empirical water, it is at the same time also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself or essence&nbsp;</em>of all other things, too, and these other things are not self-subsistent or grounded in themselves, but are<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>by, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived&nbsp;</em>from, an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>from water, that is they are ideal entities. Now above we have named the principle or the universal the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>(and still more must the Notion, the Idea, spirit be so named); and then again we have described individual, sensuous things as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>in principle, or in their Notion, still more in spirit, that is, as sublated; here we must note, in passing, this twofold aspect which showed itself in connection with the infinite, namely that on the one hand the ideal is concrete, veritable being, and on the other hand the moments of this concrete being are no less ideal &mdash; are sublated in it; but in fact what is, is only the one concrete whole from which the moments are inseparable.</p>

Such idealism is [merely] formal because it disregards the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of imagination or thought, which content in being imagined or thought can remain wholly in its finitude. In such an idealism nothing is lost, just as much because the reality of such a finite content, the existence filled with finitude, is preserved, as because, in so far as abstraction is made from such finite reality, the content is supposed to be of no consequence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself;&nbsp;</em>and in it nothing is gained for the same reason that nothing is lost, because the ego, conception, spirit, remains filled with the same content of finitude. The opposition of the form of subjectivity and objectivity is of course one of the finitudes; but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>as taken up in sensation, intuition or even in the more abstract element of conception, of thought, contains finitudes in abundance and with the exclusion of only one of the modes of finitude, namely, of the said form of subjective and objective, these finitudes are certainly not eliminated, still less have they spontaneously fallen away.</p>

The being of the beginning lacks all determination. Determinate being is sublated but only immediately sublated being. It thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, which is itself immediate; it is true that being, too, is preserved in it and both are united in determinate being in a simple unity, but for that very reason they are in themselves still unequal to each other and their unity is not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>Determinate being is therefore the sphere of difference, of dualism, the field of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such, in which being is only relatively, not absolutely determined. In being-for-self, the difference between being and determinateness or negation is posited and equalised; quality, otherness, limit &mdash; like reality, being-in-itself, the ought, and so on-are the imperfect embodiments of the negation in being in which the difference of both still lies at the base. Since, however, in finitude the negation has passed into infinity, into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>negation of negation, it is simple self-relation and consequently in its own self the equalisation with being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely determined being.</em></p>

All that is now necessary to justify our use of the term for this Notion is to demonstrate that the said Notion corresponds to the general idea associated with the expression, being-for-self. And so indeed it seems; we say that something is for itself in so far as it transcends otherness, its connection and community with other, has repelled them and made abstraction from them. For it, the other has being only as sublated, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its moment;&nbsp;</em>being-for-self consists in having so transcended limitation, its otherness, that it is, as this negation, the infinite return into itself. Consciousness, even as such, contains in principle the determination of being-for-self in that it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">represents&nbsp;</em>to itself an object which it senses, or intuits, and so forth; that is, it has<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within it&nbsp;</em>the content of the object, which in this manner has an &#39;ideal&#39; being; in its very intuiting and, in general, in its entanglement with the negative of itself, with its other, consciousness is still only in the presence of its own self. Being-for-self is the polemical, negative attitude towards the limiting other, and through this negation of the latter is a reflectedness-into-self, although along with this return of consciousness into itself and the ideality of the object, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality&nbsp;</em>of the object&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is also&nbsp;</em>still preserved, in that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at the same time&nbsp;</em>known as an external existence. Consciousness thus belongs to the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Appearance,&nbsp;</em>or is the dualism, on the one hand of knowing an alien object external to it, and on the other hand of being for its own self, having the object ideally [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideell</em>] present in it; of being not only in the presence of the other, but therein being in the presence of its own self.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Self-consciousness,&nbsp;</em>on the other hand, is being-for-self as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consummated and posited;&nbsp;</em>the side of connection with an other, with an external object, is removed. Self-consciousness is thus the nearest example of the presence of infinity; granted, of an infinity which is still abstract, yet which, at the same time, is a very different concrete determination from being-for-self in general, the infinity of which has a determinateness which is still quite qualitative.</p>

But being, which in such determinateness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>being, is also at once distinct from being-for-self, which is only being-for-self in so far as its determinateness is the infinite one above-mentioned; nevertheless, determinate being is at the same time also a moment of being-for-self; for this latter, of course, also contains being charged with negation. Thus the determinateness which in determinate being as such is an other, and a being-for-other, is bent back into the infinite unity of being-for-self, and the moment of determinate being is present in being-for-self as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-one.</em></p>

In being-for-self, negation is not present as a determinateness or limit, or consequently as a relation to a determinate being which is for it an other. Now though this moment has been designated&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as being-for-one,&nbsp;</em>there is as yet nothing present for which it would be-no one, of which it would be the moment. There is, in fact, nothing of the kind as yet fixed in being-for-self; that for which something (and here there is no something) would be, whatever the other side as such might be, is likewise a moment, is itself only a being-for-one, not yet a one. Consequently, what we have before us is still an undistinguishedness of the two sides which may be suggested by being-for-one; there is only one being- orother, and because there is only one, this too is only a being-for-one; there is only the one ideality of that, for which or in which there is supposed to be a determination as moment, and of that which is supposed to be a moment in it. Being-for-one and being-for-self are, therefore, not genuinely opposed determinatenesses. If the difference is assumed for a moment and we speak of a being-for-self, then it is this itself which, as the sublatedness of otherness, relates itself to itself as the sublated other, and is therefore &#39;for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&#39;;&nbsp;</em>it is related in its other only to its own self. Ideal being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ideelles</em>] is necessarily &#39;for one&#39;, but it is not for an other; the one for which it is, is only itself. The ego, therefore, spirit as such, or God, are &#39;ideal&#39; because they are infinite; but as being for themselves they are not &#39;ideally&#39; different from that which is &#39;for one&#39;. For if they were, they would be only immediate existences, or, more precisely, determinate being and a being-for-other, because that which would be for them would be, not themselves but an other, if they were supposed to lack the moment of being &#39;for one&#39;. God is, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for himself&nbsp;</em>in so far as he himself is that which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for him.</em></p>

This expression is in its origin idealistic, since it does not ask what this thing A is for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another&nbsp;</em>thing B, not what this man is for another man; on the contrary, it asks what this thing, this man, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for a thing, for a man,&nbsp;</em>so that this being-for-one has at the same time returned into this thing, into this man himself; in other words that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">which is,&nbsp;</em>and that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for which&nbsp;</em>it is, are one and the same &mdash; an identity, such as ideality also must be considered to be.</p>

But thus the ideal is again one of the moments, and the real the other; but the significance of ideality is that both determinations are equally only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for one&nbsp;</em>and count only for one, which one ideality is, without distinction, reality. In this sense self-consciousness, spirit, God, is ideal as an infinite relation purely to self. Ego is for ego, both are the same, the ego is twice named, but so that each of the two is only a &#39;for-one&#39;, is ideal; spirit is only for spirit, God only for God, and this unity alone is God, God as spirit. Self-consciousness, however, as consciousness, enters into the difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of itself&nbsp;</em>and of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>&nbsp;&mdash; or of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideality,&nbsp;</em>in which it produces conceptions, and of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality,&nbsp;</em>inasmuch as its conception has a determinate content which still has the side of being known as the unsublated negative, as a real, determinate being. However, to call thought, spirit, God,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>an ideal being, presupposes the standpoint from which finite being counts as the real, and the ideal being or being-for-one has only a one-sided meaning.</p>

As to the manner in which it is carried through, a further observation may be made in connection with the category we have reached. This carrying through of the principle depends primarily on whether the finite reality still retains an independent self-subsistence alongside the being-for-self, but also on whether in the infinite itself the moment&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of being-for-one,&nbsp;</em>a relationship of the ideal to itself as ideal, is posited. Thus the Eleatic Being or Spinoza&#39;s substance is only the abstract negation of all determinateness, without ideality being posited in substance itself. With Spinoza, as will be mentioned later, infinity is only the absolute<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmation&nbsp;</em>of a thing, hence only the unmoved unity; consequently, substance does not even reach the determination of being-for-self, much less that of subject and spirit. The idealism of the noble Malebranche is in itself more explicit. It contains the following fundamental thoughts: because God includes within himself all eternal truths, the ideas and perfections of all things, so that they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">his</em>and his alone, we see them only in him; God awakens in us our sensations of objects by an action in which there is nothing sensuous, whereby we imagine to ourselves that we obtain not only the idea of the object which represents its essential nature, but also the sensation of its existence. As then the eternal truths and Ideas (essentialities) of things are in God, are ideal, so also is their existence in God ideal, not an actual existence; though they are our objects, they are only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for one.&nbsp;</em>This moment of explicit and concrete idealism which is lacking in Spinozism is present here, in that absolute ideality is characterised as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">knowing.&nbsp;</em>Pure and profound as this idealism is, the above relations on the one hand still contain much that is indeterminate for thought and, on the other hand, their content is directly quite concrete (sin and salvation, etc., enter directly into them); the logical determination of infinity on which they would have to be based is not explicitly realised, and thus this lofty and rich idealism, though it is the product of a pure, speculative spirit, is still not the product of a pure, speculative thinking which alone can truly establish it.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: center; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 326</p>

The ideating being, the monad, of Leibniz is essentially ideal [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ideelles</em>]. Ideation is a being-for-self in which the determinatenesses are not limits, and consequently not a determinate being, but only moments. Ideation is also, it is true, a more concrete determination, but here it has no further signification than that of ideality; for with Leibniz, even that which lacks consciousness is an ideating, percipient being. In this system, then, otherness is sublated; spirit and body, or the monads generally, are not others for one another, they do not limit one another and do not affect one another; all relationships generally which are based on a determinate being fall away. The diversity is only ideal and inner and in it the monad remains related only to itself; the alterations develop within the monad and are not relations of it to others. What is taken to be, in accordance with the real determination, a determinately existent relation of the monads to one another, is an independent, only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simultaneous becoming,&nbsp;</em>enclosed within the being-for-self of each of them. That there is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality of monads,&nbsp;</em>that therefore they are also determined as others, does not concern the monads themselves; this is the reflection, external to them &#39; of a third. They are not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves others to one another;&nbsp;</em>the being-for-self is kept pure, and is free from the accompaniment of any real being. But herein lies, too, the inadequacy of this system. The monads are such ideating, percipient beings only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves, or in God&nbsp;</em>as the monad of monads, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">even in the system.&nbsp;</em>Otherness is equally present, whether in the ideation itself or in whatever shape the third assumes which considers them as others, as a plurality. The plurality of their determinate being is only excluded, and that only momentarily, the monads being posited as not-others only by abstraction. If it is a third which posits their otherness, it is also a third which sublates it; but this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">entire movement which gives them their ideality&nbsp;</em>falls outside them. Should it be pointed out that this movement of thought itself falls, nevertheless, only within an ideating monad, the reply must be that the very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;of such thinking is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself external to itself</em>. The transition from the oneness of absolute ideality (the monad of monads) to the category of the abstract (connectionless)<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality&nbsp;</em>of determinate being, is immediate and uncomprehended (it is effected through the image of creation); and the transition from this plurality back to the oneness is equally abstract. Ideality, ideation generally, remains something formal, as also does ideation raised to the form of consciousness. just as consciousness is conceived as a one-sided form which is indifferent to its determination and content, in the above-mentioned fancy of Leibniz &mdash; namely, that the magnetic needle, if it possessed consciousness, would regard its direction to the north as freely determined by itself &mdash; so, too, ideality in the monads is a form remaining external to the plurality. Ideality is supposed to be immanent in them, their nature is supposed to be ideation; but their relationship is on the one hand their harmony, which does not fall within the sphere of their determinate being and is, consequently, pre-established; and on the other hand, this determinate being of theirs is not grasped as a being-for-other, or, further, as ideality, but is determined only as an abstract plurality; the ideality of the plurality and the further determination of it to harmony are not immanent in and proper to this plurality itself.</p>

The abstraction which has developed into this form has acquired a greater determinateness than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of Parmenides and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>of Heraclitus. Lofty as is this abstraction, in that it makes this simple determinateness of the one and the void the principle of all things, deriving the infinite variety of the world from this simple antithesis and boldly presuming to know the former from the latter, it is equally easy for figurate conception to picture here atoms and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>them the void. It is, therefore, no wonder that the atomistic principle has at all times been upheld; the equally trivial and external relation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">composition</em>&nbsp;which must be added to achieve a semblance of concreteness and variety is no less popular than the atoms themselves and the void. The one and the void is being-for-self, the highest qualitative being-within-self, sunk back into complete&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality; the</em>&nbsp;immediacy or being of the one, because it is the negation of all otherness, is posited as being no longer determinable and alterable; such therefore is its absolute, unyielding rigidity that all determination, variety, conjunction remains for it an utterly external relation.</p>

That the void is the source of movement has not the trivial meaning that something can only move into an empty space and not into an already occupied space, for in such a space it would not find any more open room &mdash; understood in this sense, the void would be only the presupposition or condition of movement, not its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>just as the movement itself, too, would be presupposed as already existing, the essential point, its ground, being forgotten. The view that the void constitutes the ground of movement contains the profounder thought that in the negative as such there lies the ground of becoming, of the unrest of self-movement &mdash; in which sense, however, the negative is to be taken as the veritable negativity of the infinite. The void is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of movement only as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>relation of the one to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative,&nbsp;</em>to the one, that is to itself, which however is posited as having determinate being.</p>

Physics with its molecules and particles suffers from the atom, this principle of extreme externality, which is thus utterly devoid of the Notion, just as much as does that theory of the State which starts from the particular will of individuals.</p>

Each of these moments has negation for its determination and is at the same time posited as a determinate being; according to the former determination the one and the void are the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of negation to negation as of an other to its other: the one is negation in the determination of being, and the void is negation in the determination of non-being. But the one is essentially self-relation only as related&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation,&nbsp;</em>that is, it is itself that which the void outside it is supposed to be. Each, however, is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as an affirmative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being,&nbsp;</em>one as a being-for-self as such, the other an unspecified determinate being in general, and each is related to the other as to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another determinate being.</em></p>

As an explication of what the one is in itself, the becoming of the many, or the generation of the many, vanishes immediately; the products of the process are ones, and these are not for an other, but relate themselves infinitely to themselves.

The one, in repelling itself, remains self-related, like that which to begin with is taken as repelled. That the ones are related to one another as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">others</em>, are brought together into the determinateness of plurality, does not therefore concern the ones. If plurality were a relation of the ones themselves to one another then they would limit one another and there would be affirmatively present in them a being-for-other. Their relation-and this they have through their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;unity &mdash; as here&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>is determined as none: it is again the previously posited void. The void is their limit but a limit which is external to them, in which they are not to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for one another.&nbsp;</em>The limit is that in which what are limited both are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and are not</em>: but the void is determined as pure non-being, and this alone constitutes their limit.</p>

It is a simple relating of the one to the one, and no less also the absolute absence of relation in the one; it is the former according to the simple, affirmative self-relation of the one, and the latter according to the self-same relation as negative. In other words, the plurality of the one is its own positing; the one is nothing but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative</em>&nbsp;relation of the one to itself, and this relation-and therefore the one itself-is the plural one. But equally, plurality is absolutely external to the one; for the one is, precisely, the sublating of otherness; repulsion is its self-relation and simple equality with itself.

We may add here that this idealism which started from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideating monad,</em>which is determined as being for itself, advanced only as far as the repulsion just considered, and indeed only to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality as</em>&nbsp;such, in which each of the ones is only for its own self and is indifferent to the determinate being and being-for-self of the others; or, in general, for the one, there are no others at all. The monad is, by itself, the entire closed universe; it requires none of the others. But this inner manifoldness which it possesses in its ideational activity in no way affects its character as a being-for-self. The Leibnizian idealism takes up the plurality immediately as something given and does not grasp it as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repulsion&nbsp;</em>of the monads. Consequently, it possesses plurality only on the side of its abstract externality. The atomistic philosophy does not possess the Notion of ideality; it does not grasp the one as an ideal being, that is, as containing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself&nbsp;</em>the two moments of being-forself and being-for-it, but only as a simple, dry, real being-for-self. It does, however, go beyond mere indifferent plurality; the atoms become further determined in regard to one another even though, strictly speaking, this involves an inconsistency; whereas, on the contrary, in that indifferent independence of the monads, plurality remains as a fixed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fundamental determination,&nbsp;</em>so that the connection between them falls only in the monad of monads, or in the philosopher who contemplates them.</p>

It is true that since they are, they would not be negated by this negating, which for them is only something external; this negating by the other rebounds off them and touches only their surface. And yet it is only through this negating of the others that the ones return into themselves: they are only as this mediation, and this their return is their self-preservation and their being-for-self. Since their negating is ineffectual because of the resistance offered by the ones either as simply affirmative or as negating, they do not return into themselves, do not preserve themselves, and so are not.</p>

This is not only a relating of them by us, an external bringing of them together; on the contrary, repulsion is itself a relating; the one which excludes the ones relates itself to them, to the ones, that is, to its own self. Hence the negative relationship of the ones to one another is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">going-together-with-self</em>. This identity into which their repelling passes over is the sublating of their diversity and externality which they, as excluding, ought rather to maintain relatively to one another.</p>

It is the supreme, most stubborn error, which takes itself for the highest truth, manifesting in more concrete forms as abstract freedom, pure ego and, further, as Evil. It is that freedom which so misapprehends itself as to place its essence in this abstraction, and flatters itself that in thus being with itself it possesses itself in its purity. More specifically, this self-subsistence is the error of regarding as negative that which is its own essence, and of adopting a negative attitude towards it. Thus it is the negative attitude towards itself which, in seeking to possess its own being destroys it, and this its act is only the manifestation of the futility of this act. The reconciliation is the recognition that the object of this negative attitude is rather its own essence, and is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">letting go&nbsp;</em>of the negativity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of its&nbsp;</em>being-for-self instead of holding fast to it.</p>

We may repeat here the observation that the truth of the one and the many expressed in propositions appears in an inappropriate form, that this truth is to be grasped and expressed only as a becoming, as a process, a repulsion and attraction-not as being, which in a proposition has the character of a stable unity. We have already mentioned and recalled the dialectic of Plato in the Parmenides concerning the derivation of the many from the one, namely, from the proposition: the one is. The inner dialectic of the Notion has been stated; it is easiest to grasp the dialectic of the proposition, that the many are one, as an external reflection; and it may properly be grasped externally here inasmuch as the object too, the many, are mutually external. It directly follows from this comparison of the many with one another that any one is determined simply like any other one; each is a one, each is one of the many,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>by excluding the others &mdash; so that they are absolutely the same, there is present one and only one determination. This is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fact,&nbsp;</em>and all that has to be done is to grasp this simple fact. The only reason why the understanding stubbornly refuses to do so is that it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>in mind, and indeed rightly so, the difference; but the existence of this difference is just as little excluded because of the said fact, as is the certain existence of the said fact in spite of the difference. One could, as it were, comfort understanding for the naive manner in which it grasps the fact of the difference, by assuring it that the difference will also come in again.</p>

In attraction, however, ideality is realised. Repulsion passes over into attraction, the many ones into one one. Both repulsion and attraction are in the first place distinct from each other, the former as the reality of the ones, the latter as their posited ideality. The relation of attraction to repulsion is such that the former has the latter<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for presupposition.&nbsp;</em>Repulsion provides the material for attraction. If there were no ones there would be nothing to attract; the conception of a perpetual attraction, of an absorption of the ones, presupposes an equally perpetual production of them. Spatial attraction as pictorially conceived makes the flow of attracted ones proceed uninterruptedly; in place of the atoms which vanish in the centre of attraction, another multitude comes forth from the void, and so on to infinity if one wishes. If attraction were conceived as accomplished, the many being brought to the point of the one one, then there would be present only an inert one and no longer any attraction. The ideality present in attraction still also bears within itself the determination of the negation of itself, the many ones of which it is the relatedness: attraction is inseparable from repulsion.</p>

But there can be no question here of a precedence of such a one over another, for this would presuppose a specific difference between them; rather is attraction the positing of the immediately present undifferentiatedness of the ones. It is only attraction itself that is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing&nbsp;</em>of a one distinct from other ones; these are only immediate ones which should maintain themselves through repulsion; but through their posited negation arises the one of attraction, which is consequently determined as mediated, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one posited as one.&nbsp;</em>The first ones, as immediate, do not in their ideality return into themselves but have this ideality in another one.</p>

As such, repulsion is indifferent to attraction which is externally added to it as thus presupposed. Attraction on the other hand is not presupposed by repulsion in such a manner that the former is supposed to have no part in the positing and being of the latter, that is, as if repulsion were not already in its own self the negation of itself and the ones were not already in themselves negated. In this way we have repulsion abstractly on its own account and, similarly, attraction relatively to the ones as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmatively&nbsp;</em>present, has the side of an immediate determinate being and comes to them as an other.</p>

But repulsion is not merely the void; the ones, as unrelated, do not repel or exclude one another, this constitutes their determination. Repulsion is, although negative, still essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation;&nbsp;</em>the mutual repulsion and flight is not a liberation from what is repelled and fled from, the one as excluding still remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">related</em>&nbsp;to what it excludes. But this moment of relation is attraction and thus is in repulsion itself; it is the negating of that abstract repulsion according to which the ones would be only self-related affirmative beings not excluding one another.</p>

That each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>only a moment, is the transition of each out of itself into the other, the self-negating of each in itself and the self-positing of each as its own other. The one as such, then, is a coming-out-of-itself, is only the positing of itself as its own other, as many; and the many, similarly, is only this, to collapse within itself and to posit itself as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its</em>other, as one, and in this very act to be related only to its own self, each continuing itself in its other. Thus there is already present in principle (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>) the undividedness of the coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and the self-positing as one (attraction).

The repulsion of the determinately existent ones is the self-preservation of the one through the mutual repulsion of the others, so that&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(1)</span>&nbsp;the other ones are negated in it-this is the side of its determinate being or of its being-for-other; but this is thus attraction as the ideality of the ones; and&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(2)</span>&nbsp;the one is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>, without relation to the others; but not only has being-in-itself as such long since passed over into being-for-self, but the one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>, by its determination, is the aforesaid becoming of many ones. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction</em>&nbsp;of the determinately existent ones is their ideality and the positing of the one, in which, accordingly, attraction as a negating and a generating of the one sublates itself, and as a positing of the one is in its own self the negative of itself, repulsion.</p>

The sublating, at first determined as only a relative sublating of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to another determinately existent one-a relation which is thus itself not an indifferent repulsion and attraction &mdash; equally displays itself as passing over into the infinite relation of mediation through negation of the external relations of the immediate, determinately existent ones, and as having for result that very process of becoming which, in the instability of its moments, is the collapse, or rather going-together-with-itself, into simple immediacy.

This relation to other contradicts the immediacy in which qualitative determinateness is self-relation. This otherness sublates itself in the infinity of being-for-self which makes explicit the difference (which in the negation of the negation is present in it) in the form of the one and the many and their relations, and has raised the qualitative moment to a genuine unity, that is, a unity which is no longer immediate but is posited as accordant with itself.</p>

This determination of them and &mdash; the relationships connected with it have to be compared with the Notions which have resulted from our consideration of them. Conceived as forces, they are regarded as self-subsistent and therefore as not connected with each other through their own nature; that is, they are considered not as moments, each of which is supposed to pass into the other, but rather as fixed in their opposition to each other. Further, they are imagined as meeting in a third, in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matter</em>, but in such a manner, that this unification is, counted, as their truth., on the contrary; each is regarded also as a first, as being in and for itself, and matter, or its determinations, are supposed to be realised and produced by them. When it is said that matter has the forces&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself</em>, they are understood to be so conjoined in this unity that they are at the same time presupposed as intrinsically free and independent of each other.</p>

He presupposes the idea of matter and then asks what forces are required to maintain the determinations he has presupposed. Thus, on the one hand, he demands the force of attraction because, properly speaking, through repulsion alone and without attraction matter could not exist; and on the other hand he derives repulsion, too, from matter and gives as the reason that we think of matter as impenetrable, since it presents itself under this category to the sense of touch by which it manifests itself to us. Consequently, he proceeds, repulsion is at once thought in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept&nbsp;</em>of matter because it is immediately given therein, whereas attraction is added to the concept&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">syllogistically.&nbsp;</em>But these syllogisms, too, are based on what has just been said, namely, that matter which possessed repulsive force alone, would not exhaust our conception of matter.</p>

However, it is hard to perceive what this difference is supposed to be; for a determination which belongs to the concept of anything&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">must&nbsp;</em>be truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contained in it.</em></p>

But if, further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>of matter is supposed to be impossible without attraction, then this assertion is based on a conception of matter taken from sense perception; consequently, the determination of attraction, too, must come within the range of sense perception. It is indeed easy to perceive that matter, besides its being-for-self, which sublates the being-for-other (offers resistance), has also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>between its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self</em>-<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined parts,&nbsp;</em>a spatial<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extension and cohesion,&nbsp;</em>and in rigidity and solidity the cohesion is very firm. Physics explains that the tearing apart, etc., of a body requires a force which shall be stronger than the mutual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction&nbsp;</em>of the parts of the body. From this observation reflection can just as directly derive the force of attraction or assume it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given,&nbsp;</em>as it did with the force of repulsion. In point of fact, if we consider Kant&#39;s arguments from which the force of attraction is supposed to be deduced (the proof of the proposition that the possibility of matter requires a force of attraction as a second fundamental force,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">loc. cit.),&nbsp;</em>it is apparent that their sole content is this, that through repulsion alone matter would not be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial&nbsp;</em>Matter being presupposed as filling space, it is credited with continuity, the ground of which is assumed to be the force of attraction.</p>

Kant is chiefly concerned to banish the vulgar mechanistic way of thinking which stops short at the one determination of impenetrability, of self-determined and self-subsistent puncticity, and converts into something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>the opposite determination, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of</em>&nbsp;matter within itself or the relation of a plurality of matters, which in turn are regarded as particular ones &mdash; a way of thinking which, as Kant says, will admit no motive forces except pressure and thrust, that is, only action from without. This<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>manner of thinking always presupposes motion as already externally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">present</em>&nbsp;in matter, and it does not occur to it to regard motion as something immanent and to comprehend motion itself in matter, which latter is thus assumed as, on its own account, motionless and inert. This stand-point has before it only ordinary mechanics, not immanent and free motion. It is true that Kant sublates this externality in so far as he makes attraction (the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of matters to one another in so far as these are assumed as separated from one another, or matter generally in its self-externality) a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">force of matter itself</em>; still, on the other hand, his two fundamental forces within matter remain external to and completely independent of each other.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">But here we must remember that in assuming &#39;nearer&#39; or &#39;more distant&#39; parts of matter, the same distinction would likewise arise with respect to attraction, namely, that though one atom acted on another, yet a third, more distant atom (between which and the first atom, the second atom would be), would first enter into the sphere of attraction of the intervening atom nearer to it; therefore the first atom would not have an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate,&nbsp;</em>simple action on the third, from which it would follow that the action of the force of attraction, like that of repulsion, is equally mediated. Further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genuine penetration&nbsp;</em>of the force of attraction could of necessity consist only in this, that every part of matter was in and for itself attractive, not that a certain number of atoms behaved passively and only one atom actively. But we must at once remark with respect to the force of repulsion itself that in the passage quoted, &#39;parts in contact&#39; are mentioned which implies&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">solidity and continuity&nbsp;</em>of a matter already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finished and complete&nbsp;</em>which would not permit the passage through it of a repelling force. But this solidity of matter in which parts are in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contact&nbsp;</em>and are no longer separated by the void already presupposes that the force of repulsion is sublated; according to the sensuous conception of repulsion which prevails here, parts in contact are to be taken as those which do not repel each other. It therefore follows, quite tautologically, that where repulsion is assumed to be not, there no repulsion can take place. But from this nothing else follows which could serve to determine the force of repulsion. However, reflection on the statement that parts in contact are in contact only in so far as they hold themselves apart, leads directly to the conclusion that the force of repulsion is not merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">on the surface&nbsp;</em>of matter but within the sphere which was supposed to be only a sphere of attraction.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">Kant assumes further that &#39;through the force of attraction, matter only occupies space but does not fill it&#39;; and &#39;because matter through the force of attraction does not fill space, this force can act across empty space since there is no intervening matter to limit it&#39;. This distinction is much the same as the one mentioned above where a determination was supposed to belong to the concept of a thing but not to be contained in it; here, then, matter is supposed only to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occupy&nbsp;</em>a space but not to fill it. There it is repulsion, if we stop at the first determination of matter, through which the ones repel one another and so are only negatively related to one another, here that means, by empty space. Here, however, it is the force of attraction which keeps space empty; it does not fill space by its connection of the atoms, in other words, it keeps the atoms in a negative relation to one another. We see that Kant here unconsciously realises what is implicit in the nature of the subject matter, when he attributes to the force of attraction precisely what, in accordance with the first determination, he attributed to the opposite force. While he was busy with establishing the difference between the two forces, it happened that one had passed over into the other. Thus through repulsion, on the other hand, matter is supposed to fill a space, and consequently through repulsion the empty space left by the force of attraction vanishes. In point of fact repulsion, in doing away with empty space, also destroys the negative relation of the atoms or ones, that is, their repulsion of one another; in -other words, repulsion is determined as the opposite of itself.</p>

In the definition of surface and penetrative force both are assumed as motive forces by means of which matter is supposed to be able to act in one or other of these ways. Here, therefore, they are represented as forces, not through which matter first comes into being but through which matter, as an already finished product, is only set in motion. But in so far as we are speaking of the forces through which different bodies act on one another and are set in motion, this is something quite different from the determination and relation which these forces were supposed to have as [constitutive] moments of matter.</p>

These appear to offer an essential distinction, since in their sphere there is a fixed single one, a centre, in relation to which the other ones behave as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not for themselves,&nbsp;</em>so that the difference between the forces can be linked to this presupposed difference between a single central one and the others which are not independent relatively to it. But if they are to be used for explanation &mdash; for which purpose they are assumed to be (like the forces of repulsion and attraction) in an inverse quantitative ratio so that the one increases as the other decreases &mdash; then the phenomenon of the motion and its inequality ought to be the result of these forces which were assumed for the purpose of explanation. However, one need only examine the accounts (any of them will do) of a phenomenon like the unequal velocity of a planet in its orbit round the sun, based on the opposition of these forces, to become aware of the confusion which prevails in such explanations, and the impossibility of disentangling the magnitudes of the forces, so that the one which in the explanation is assumed to be decreasing can just as well be assumed to be increasing, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa</em>. To make this evident would require a lengthier exposition than could be given here; but what is necessary for this purpose is adduced later on in connection with the inverted relation.</p>

Quality is the first, immediate determinateness, quantity is the determinateness which has become indifferent to being, a limit which is just as much no limit, being-for-self which is absolutely identical with being-for-other &mdash; a repulsion of the many ones which is directly the non-repulsion, the continuity of them.</p>

It becomes quantum. Quantum is indifferent determinateness, that is, a self-transcending, self-negating determinateness; as this otherness of otherness it relapses into the infinite progress. But the infinite quantum is the indifferent determinate<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ness sublated,&nbsp;</em>it is the restoration of quality.</p>

Quantum transcends itself only generally: in ratio, however, its transition into its otherness is such that this otherness in which it has its determination is at the same time posited, is another quantum.

If, however, by limit we mean quantitative limit, then when, for example, a field alters its limit it still remains what it was before, a field. If on the other hand its qualitative limit is altered, then since this is the determinateness which makes it a field, it becomes a meadow, wood, and so on. A red, whether brighter or paler, is still red; but if it altered its quality it would cease to be red, would become blue or some other colour. The determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude&nbsp;</em>as quantum reached above, namely that it has a permanent substratum of being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">which is indifferent to its determinateness,&nbsp;</em>can be found in any other example.</p>

A magnitude is usually defined as that which can be increased or diminished. But to increase means to make the magnitude more, to decrease, to make the magnitude less. In this there lies a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of magnitude as such from itself and magnitude would thus be that of which the magnitude can be altered. The definition thus proves itself to be inept in so far as the same term is used in it which was to have been defined. Since the same term must not be used in the definition, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more and less&nbsp;</em>can be resolved into an affirmative addition which, in accordance with the nature of quantum, is likewise external, and a subtraction, as an equally external negation.

Quantity is, as such, this simple result in so far as being-for-self has not yet developed its moments and posited them within itself. It&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contains</em>&nbsp;them to begin with as being-for-self posited as it is in truth. The determination of being-for-self was to be a self-sublating relation-to-self, a perpetual coming-out-of-itself. But what is repelled is itself; repulsion is, therefore, the creative flowing away of itself. On account of the self-sameness of what is repelled, this distinguishing or differentiation is an uninterrupted continuity; and because of the coming-out-of-itself this continuity, without being interrupted, is at the same time a plurality, which no less immediately remains in its self-identicalness.</p>

The presence in it of discreteness as a moment can be expressed by saying that quantity is simply the omnipresent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real possibility</em>&nbsp;within itself of the one, but conversely that the one is no less absolutely continuous.</p>

But it has been shown that the one essentially and spontaneously (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an und f&uuml;r sich selbst</em>) passes over into attraction, into its ideality, and that consequently continuity is not external to it but belongs to it and is grounded in its very nature. It is just this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of continuity for the ones to which atomism clings and which ordinary thinking finds it difficult to forsake. Mathematics, on the other hand, rejects a metaphysics which would make time<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist&nbsp;</em>of points of time; space in general &mdash; or in the first place the line &mdash;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist</em>&nbsp;of points of space; the plane, of lines; and total space of planes. It allows no validity to such discontinuous ones. Even though, for instance, in determining the magnitude of a plane, it represents it as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of infinitely many lines, this discreteness counts only as a momentary representation, and the sublation of the discreteness is already implied in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>plurality of the lines, since the space which they are supposed to constitute is after all bounded.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Quantity is conceived by us in two manners, to wit, abstractly and superficially, as an offspring of imagination or as a substance, which is done by the intellect alone. If, then, we look at quantity as it is in the imagination, which we often and very easily do, it will be found to be finite, divisible, and composed of parts; but if we look at it as it is in the intellect and conceive it, in so far as it is a substance, which is done with great difficulty, then as we have already sufficiently shown, it will be found to be infinite, without like, and indivisible. This, to all who know how to distinguish between the imagination and the intellect, will be quite clear.&#39;</p>

As regards&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matter&nbsp;</em>as quantity, among the seven surviving propositions of the first dissertation of Leibniz there is one, the second, which runs:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Non omnino improbabile est, materiam et quantitatem esse realiter idem.&nbsp;</em>In fact, the distinction between these two concepts is simply this, that quantity is a determination of pure thought, whereas matter is the same determination in outer existence. The determination of pure quantity belongs also to the ego which is an absolute becoming-other, an infinite removal or all-round repulsion to the negative freedom of being-for-self which, however, remains utterly simple continuity &mdash; the continuity of universality or being-with-self uninterrupted by the infinitely manifold limits, by the content of sensations, intuitions, and so forth. Those who reject the idea of plurality as a simple unity and besides the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of it, to wit, that each of the many is the same as every other, namely, a one of the many &mdash; since here we are not speaking of the many as further determined, as green, red, and so on, but of the many considered in and for itself &mdash; demand also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation&nbsp;</em>of this unity, will find plenty of instances in those continua which exhibit the deduced Notion of quantity as present in simple intuition.</p>

But this exposition with all its merits is imperfect; its course is impeded and tangled, and also it is false in regard to its result, which presupposes that cognition has no other forms of thought than finite categories. In both respects these antinomies deserve a more exact critical appraisal which will not only throw more light on their standpoint and method but will also free the main point at issue from the useless form into which it has been forced.</p>

But profounder insight into the antinomial, or more truly into the dialectical nature of reason demonstrates any Notion whatever to be a unity of opposed moments to which, therefore, the form of antinomial assertions could be given. Becoming, determinate being, etc., and any other Notion, could thus provide its particular antinomy, and thus as many antinomies could be constructed as there are Notions.</p>

In order to possess the antinomy in its purity and to deal with it in its simple Notion, the determinations of thought must not be taken in their application to and entanglement in the general idea of the world, of space, time, matter, etc; this concrete material must be omitted from consideration of these determinations which it is powerless to influence and which must be considered purely on their own account since they alone constitute the essence and the ground of the antinomies.</p>

Its genuine solution can only be this: two opposed determinations which belong necessarily to one and the same Notion cannot be valid each on its own in its one-sidedness; on the contrary, they are true only as sublated, only in the unity of their Notion.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Every composite substance. in the world consists of simple parts, and nowhere does there exist anything but the simple or what is compounded from it.&#39;</p>

The substrate given to these abstractions, namely, substances in the world, here means nothing more than things as sensuously perceived and it has no influence on the antinomy itself; space or time could equally well be taken. Now since the thesis speaks only of composition instead of continuity it is really as it stands an analytical or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tautological&nbsp;</em>proposition. That the composite is not in its own self a one, but only something externally put together and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consisting of what is other than itself,&nbsp;</em>this is its immediate determination. But the other of the composite is the simple. It is therefore tautological to say that the composite consists of the simple. To ask of what something consists is to ask for an indication of something else, the compounding of which constitutes the said something. If ink is said to consist simply of ink, the meaning of the inquiry after the something else of which it consists has been missed and the question is not answered but only repeated. A further question then is whether that which is under discussion is supposed to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist of something&nbsp;</em>or not. But the composite is simply that which is supposed to be a combination of something else. If, however, the simple which is the other of the composite is taken only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively&nbsp;</em>simple and is itself composite, too, then the question still remains unanswered. What ordinary thinking has in mind is, perhaps, only some composite or other of which something or other, too, would be assigned as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>simple, such particular something being composite on its own account.

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Assume&#39;, he begins, &#39;that composite substances do not consist of simple parts; then if all composition were thought away no composite part and (since we have just assumed that there are no simple parts) no simple part &mdash; hence nothing at all &mdash; would remain; consequently, no substance would have been given.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">This conclusion is quite correct: if nothing but composite substances exist and all that is composite is thought away, then nothing whatever remains; this will be conceded, but this tautological redundance could be omitted and the proof straightway begin with what follows, namely:</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Either it is impossible to think away all composition, or else there remains after such removal in thought something which is not composite, that is, the simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;In the first case, however, the composite again would not consist of substances (because with these, composition is only a contingent relation of substances [In addition to the redundance of the proof itself there is here also a redundance of language &#39;because&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with these</em>&#39; (namely the substances) &#39;composition is only a contingent relation of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substances</em>&#39;.] which, apart from such relation, must still persist on their own account). Now since this case contradicts what was assumed, only the second case is left: namely, that all composite substances consist of simple parts.&#39;</p>

The dilemma is this: either the composite persists, or else the simple. If the former, that is, the composite, persists, then what persists would not be substances, for composition is for these only a contingent relation; but substances do persist, therefore, what persists is the simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;composite substance consists of simple parts&#39;, could be directly followed by the reason:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">because&nbsp;</em>composition is merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contingent&nbsp;</em>relation of substances, and is therefore external to them and does not concern the substances themselves. If the composition is in fact contingent then, of course, substances are essentially simple. But this contingency which is the sole point at issue is not proved but straightway assumed, and casually, too, in a parenthesis-as something self-evident or of secondary importance. True, it goes without saying that composition is a contingent and external determination; but if the point at issue were only a contingent togetherness instead of continuity, it would not be worth while constructing an antinomy about it &mdash; or rather it would not be possible to formulate one. Therefore, the assertion that the parts are simple is, as remarked, only a tautology.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">Let us assume that substances do not consist of simple parts but are only composite. But now all composition can be thought away (for it is only a contingent relation); after its removal, therefore, there are no substances left unless we assume that they consist of simple parts. But substances we must have for we have assumed them;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything&nbsp;</em>is not meant to vanish,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>must be left over, for we have presupposed something persistent which we called substance. Therefore this something must be simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;From this it follows, as a direct consequence, that all things in the world without exception are simple entities, that composition is only an external state of them, and that reason must think the elementary substances as simple entities.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">Here we see the externality, that is contingency, of composition put forward as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequence&nbsp;</em>after it had already been introduced parenthetically and used in the proof.</p>

But the defect of the proof in question is not so much that it is a sophism, as that its laboured, tortuous complexity serves no other purpose than to produce the merely outward semblance of a proof and partially to obscure the quite transparent fact that what was supposed to emerge as a consequence is, parenthetically, that on which the proof hinges; that there is no proof at all, but only an assumption.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts and nowhere in the world does there exist anything simple.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">The proof has equally an apagogical turn and, in a different way, is just as faulty as the previous one.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Suppose&#39;, it runs, &#39;that a composite thing as a substance consists of simple parts. Because all&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>relation, and consequently all composition of substances, is possible only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,</em>&nbsp;therefore, the space occupied by the composite substance must consist of as many parts as those of which the composite substance consists. Now space does not consist of simple parts but of spaces. Therefore each part of the composite substance must occupy a space.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;But the absolutely primary parts of everything composite are simple.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Therefore the simple occupies a space.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;Now since every real thing that occupies a space comprises a manifold of mutually external parts and is consequently composite, consisting of substances, it would follow that the simple is a composite substance-which is self-contradictory.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">This proof can be called a whole&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nest&nbsp;</em>(to use an expression elsewhere employed by Kant) of faulty procedure.</p>

For the assumption that whatever is substantial is spatial, but that space does not consist of simple parts is a direct assertion which is made the immediate ground of what is to be proved, and with this there is an end to the proving of the antithesis.</p>

For it then goes on to conclude that composition is possible only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,&nbsp;</em>that space does not consist of simple parts, and that therefore the real thing occupying a space is composite. But once composition is assumed as an external relation, then spatiality itself (in which alone composition is supposed to be possible) is for that very reason an external relation for the substances, which does not concern them or affect their nature any more than anything else does that can be inferred from the determination of spatiality. For this very reason, the substances ought not to have been put into space.</p>

This Kantian distinction between intuition and concept has, as everyone knows, given rise to a deal of nonsense about the former, and to avoid the labour of comprehension the value and sphere of intuition have been extended to the whole field of cognition. What is pertinent here is just this, that space, and also intuition itself, must be grasped in terms of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notions&nbsp;</em>if, that is, we want really to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehend.&nbsp;</em>And thus the question would arise whether space, even though a simple continuity for intuition, ought not to be grasped, in accordance with its Notion, as consisting of simple parts, or whether it would be involved in the same antinomy which applied only to substance. As a matter of fact, if the antinomy is grasped abstractly, it concerns, as we remarked, quantity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as such,&nbsp;</em>and hence equally space and time.</p>

There is also involved here a clash between the continuity of space and composition; the two are confused with each other, the former being substituted for the latter (which results in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quaternio terminorum&nbsp;</em>in the conclusion). With Kant, space has the express determination of being &#39;sole and single, its parts resting only on limitations, so that they do not precede the one, all-embracing space as, so to speak, its component parts from which it could be compounded.&#39; Here continuity is quite correctly and definitely predicated of space in denial of its composition from parts. On the other hand, in the argument the placing of substances in space is supposed to involve &#39;a manifold of mutually external parts&#39; and, more particularly, &#39;consequently a composite&#39;. Yet, as we have quoted, the way in which manifoldness is present in space is expressly intended to exclude composition and component parts antecedent to the unity of space.</p>

If by substances we are meant here to understand only bodies as we see, touch, taste them, and so on, then we are not really discussing them as they are in their Notion but only as sensuously perceived. The proof of the antithesis, then, amounted in short to this: all our visual, tactile, and other experience shows us only what is composite; even the best microscopes and the keenest knives have not enabled us to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">come across&nbsp;</em>anything simple.

When substance, matter, space, time, etc., are taken only as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete,&nbsp;</em>they are absolutely divided; their principle is the one. When they are taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous, this</em>&nbsp;one is only a sublated one; division remains a divisibility, it remains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility&nbsp;</em>of division, as a possibility, without actually reaching the atom. Now even if we stop at the determination given in what has been said about these antitheses, then the moment of the atom is contained in continuity itself, for this is simply the possibility of division; just as said dividedness, discreteness, sublates all distinction of the ones &mdash; for each of the simple ones is what the other is-consequently, also contains their sameness and hence their continuity.</p>

To consider them here, too, would be too lengthy a business; they concern the Notions of space and time and can be dealt with at the same time as these subjects and in the history of philosophy. They reflect the greatest credit on the intelligence of their inventors they have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for result&nbsp;</em>the pure being of Parmenides, in that in them is demonstrated the dissolution of all determinate being; they are thus in themselves the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">flux</em>&nbsp;of Heraclitus. For this reason they deserve a more thorough consideration than the usual explanation that they are just sophisms; which assertion sticks to empirical perception, following the procedure of Diogenes (a procedure which is so illuminating to ordinary common sense) who, when a dialectician pointed out the contradiction contained in motion, made no effort to reason it out but, by silently walking up and down, is supposed to have referred to the evidence of sight for an answer. Such assertion and refutation is certainly easier to make than to engage in thinking and to hold fast and resolve by thought alone the complexities originating in thought, and not in abstruse thought either, but in the thoughts spontaneously arising in ordinary consciousness.</p>

To infinite divisibility (which, being imagined as actually carried out, is the same as infinite dividedness, as the atoms) on which is based the most famous of those proofs, he opposes continuity, which applies equally well to time as to space, so that the infinite, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>plurality is contained only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[an sich], as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility,&nbsp;</em>in continuity. What is actual in contrast to abstract plurality as also to abstract continuity, is their concrete forms, space and time themselves, just as these latter are abstract relatively to matter and motion. What is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>has only an implicit or potential being; it only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>as a moment of something real. Bayle, who finds Aristotle&#39;s solution of the Zenonic dialectic &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pitoyable</em>&#39;, does not understand the meaning of the statement that matter is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">potentially&nbsp;</em>infinitely divisible; he rejoins that if matter is infinitely divisible, then it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually&nbsp;</em>contains an infinite number of parts, that, therefore, this infinite is not an infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">en putssance&nbsp;</em>but an infinite that really and actually exists. On the contrary, divisibility itself even is only a possibility, not an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existing&nbsp;</em>of the parts, and the plurality as such is posited in the continuity only as a moment, as sublated. Acute understanding, in which Aristotle, too, is certainly unsurpassed, is not competent to grasp and to decide on speculative Notions, any more than the crudity of sensuous conception instanced above is adequate to refute the reasoning of Zeno. Such intellect commits the error of holding such mental fictions, such abstractions, as an infinite number of parts, to be something true and actual; but this sensuous consciousness does not let itself be brought beyond the empirical element to thought.</p>

But quantity is a concrete unity only in so far as it is the unity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct&nbsp;</em>moments. These, are, therefore, also to be taken as distinct, but are not to be resolved again into attraction and repulsion, but are to be taken as they are in their truth, each remaining in its unity with the other, that is, remaining the whole. Continuity is only coherent, compact unity as unity of the discrete;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as such it is no longer only a moment but the whole of quantity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous magnitude.</em></p>

Quantity is in itself asunderness, and continuous magnitude is this asunderness continuing itself without negation as an internally self-same connectedness. But discrete magnitude is this asunderness as discontinuous, as interrupted. With this plurality of ones, however, we are not again in the presence of the plurality of atoms and the void, repulsion in general. Because discrete magnitude is quantity, its discreteness is itself continuous. This continuity in the discrete consists in the ones being the same as one another, or in having the same unity. Discrete magnitude is, therefore, the asunderness of the manifold one as self-same, not the manifold one in general but posited as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">many of a unity.</em></p>

But in quantum as number, this limit is posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manifold within itself.&nbsp;</em>It contains the many ones which constitute its determinate being, but does not contain them in an indeterminate manner, for the determinateness of the limit falls in them; the limit excludes other determinate being, that is, other pluralities and the ones it encloses are a specific aggregate, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount</em>&nbsp;&mdash; which is the form taken by discreteness in number &mdash; the other to which is the unit, the continuity of the amount.&nbsp;<a name="HL1_203a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Amount</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit</em>&nbsp;constitute the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments</em>&nbsp;of number</span>.</p>

This, however, is not indifferent to them. In the sphere of determinate being, the relation of the limit to it was primarily such that the determinate being persisted as the affirmative on this side of its limit, while the limit, the negation, was found outside on the border of the determinate being; similarly, the breaking-off [in the counting] of the many ones and the exclusion of other ones appears as a determination falling outside the enclosed ones. But in the qualitative sphere it was found that the limit pervades the determinate being, is coextensive with it, and consequently that it lies in the nature of something to be limited, that is, finite. In the quantitative sphere a number, say a hundred, is conceived in such a manner that the hundredth one alone limits the many to make them a hundred. In one sense this is correct; but on the other hand none of the hundred ones has precedence over any other for they are only equal &mdash; each is equally the hundredth; thus they all belong to the limit which makes the number a hundred and the number cannot dispense with any of them for its determinateness. Hence, relatively to the hundredth one, the others do not constitute a determinate being that is in any way different from the limit, whether they are outside or inside it. Consequently, the number is not a plurality over against the enclosing, limiting one, but itself constitutes this limitation which is a specific quantum; the many constitute a number, a two, a ten, a hundred, and so on.</p>

But this distinguishing does not become a qualitative determinateness but remains quantitative, falling only within the comparing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;reflection; the number, as a one, remains returned into itself and indifferent to others. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>of a number to others is an essential determination of it and constitutes the implicit determinedness of the number, but also the number&#39;s own externality. Number is thus a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">numerical&nbsp;</em>one as the absolutely determinate one, which at the same time has the form of simple immediacy and for which, therefore, the relation to other is completely external. Further, one as a number&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possesses determinateness&nbsp;</em>(in so far as this is a relation to other) as the moments of itself contained within it, in its difference of unit and amount; and amount is itself a plurality of ones, that is, this absolute externality is in the one itself. This contradiction of number or of quantum as such within itself is the quality of quantum, in the further determinations of which this contradiction is developed.</p>

In spatial magnitude, geometry has, in general, continuous magnitude for its subject matter while the subject matter of arithmetic is the discrete magnitude of number. But with this dissimilarity of their subject matter, the manner and completeness of their limitation or determinedness is also different. Spatial magnitude possesses only limitation generally; if it is to be considered as a thoroughly determinate quantum then&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">number&nbsp;</em>is required. Geometry as such does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measure</em>spatial figures (it is not mensuration), but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compares&nbsp;</em>them. In its definitions, too, the determinations are in part derived from the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality&nbsp;</em>of the sides and angles, or from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistance.&nbsp;</em>Thus the circle, because it is based solely on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistance&nbsp;</em>of all possible points in it from a centre, does not require number for its determination. These determinations based on equality or inequality are genuinely geometrical. But they are not sufficient, and for other figures, for example, the triangle or rectangle, number is requisite; this in its principle, the one, contains a self-determinedness, it is determined without the aid of an other and therefore not through comparison. It is true that in the point, spatial magnitude has a determinateness corresponding to the one; but the point, in becoming external to itself, becomes an other, becomes the line; because it is essentially only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial&nbsp;</em>one, it becomes in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>a continuity in which the nature of the point, the self-determinedness, the one, is sublated. In so far as the self-determinedness is supposed to be preserved in the self-externality, the line must be represented as an aggregate of ones, and to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit&nbsp;</em>must be imparted the determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">many&nbsp;</em>ones, that is, the magnitude of the line &mdash; and similarly of other spatial determinations &mdash; must be taken as a number.</p>

For number is the determinateness which is indifferent, inert; it must be actuated from without and so brought into a relation. The modes of relation are the species of calculation. In arithmetic they are presented&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seriatim&nbsp;</em>and it is clear that one depends on the other; but the thread which links the progressive stages is not made prominent in arithmetic. However, the systematic arrangement justly claimed for the presentation of these elements in the textbooks is readily provided by the determinations of number itself stemming from its Notion. These cardinal determinations will be briefly noted here.</p>

The first production of number is the aggregating of the many as such, each of which then is posited as only a one &mdash; numbering or counting. Since the ones are mutually external their representation is illustrated sensuously, and the operation by which number is generated is a process of counting on the fingers, dots, and so on. What four, five, etc.,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>can only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">be pointed out.&nbsp;</em>Seeing that the limit is an external one, the breaking off of the counting, the amount to be aggregated, is contingent, arbitrary. The difference of amount and unit which appears in the progress from one species of calculation to another, establishes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a system&nbsp;</em>of numbers, dyadic, decadic, and so on; such a system rests on the whole on the arbitrary choice of an amount which is consistently to be taken as unit.</p>

The sum of 5 and 7 means the mechanical [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begrifflose</em>] conjunction of the two numbers, and the counting from seven onwards thus mechanically continued until the five units are exhausted can be called a putting together, a synthesis, just like counting from one onwards; but it is a synthesis wholly analytical in nature, for the connection is quite artificial, there is nothing in it or put into it which is not quite externally given. The postulate that 5 be added to 7, bears the same relation to the postulate of simply counting, as does the postulate that a straight line be produced to the postulate that a straight line be drawn.</p>

He admits that several are really analytic but only adduces one in support of his assertion that they are synthetic, namely, the axiom that the straight line is the shortest line between two points. &#39;For my notion of straightness contains nothing pertaining to magnitude, but only a quality; the notion of the shortest is, therefore, wholly an addition and cannot be inferred from any analysis of the notion of a straight line; we must therefore have recourse to intuition here which alone makes the synthesis possible.&#39; But here again the question is not of a notion of straightness as such but of a straight line, and this is already something spatial and intuited. The determination (or, if you like, the concept) of the straight line is, after all, none other than that the line is absolutely simple, that is, in coming out of itself (the so-called movement of the point) the line is purely self-related, and its extension does not involve any alteration in its determination, or reference to another point or line outside itself; it is a simple direction purely internal to the line. This simplicity is indeed its quality, and should it seem difficult to define the straight line analytically this would be due solely to the simplicity and self-relation of the determination, and merely because reflection thinks of determining primarily in terms of a plurality, a determining through something else. But there is no inherent difficulty whatever in grasping this determination of the simplicity of extension within the line, of the absence of determination by anything else; Euclid&#39;s definition contains nothing else than this simplicity. But now the transition of this quality to the quantitative determination (of the shortest) which is supposed to constitute the synthetic element is wholly analytical. As spatial, the line is quantity in general; the simplest in terms of quantum is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">least;&nbsp;</em>and this predicated of a line is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">shortest.&nbsp;</em>Geometry can accept these determinations as a corollary to the definition; but Archimedes in his books on the sphere and cylinder&#39; did the appropriate thing in making the said determination of a straight line into an axiom, in just as correct a sense as Euclid included the determination concerning parallel lines among the axioms, for the development of this determination into a definition would have required determinations not immediately spatial in character but of a more abstract qualitative kind, like simplicity, sameness of direction, and the like just mentioned. These ancients gave even to their sciences a plastic character, confining their exposition strictly to the peculiarity of their subject matter and therefore excluding what would have been heterogeneous to it.</p>

Of course, this notion is also present in intuition since it is the Notion itself and everything is implicitly the Notion; but the determinations selected in those examples do not exhibit it. On the contrary, number and counting is an identity and the creating of an identity which is wholly and solely external, only a superficial synthesis, a unity of ones which are, in fact, posited as inherently not identical with one another but as external, each separate on its own account; the determination of the straight line as being the shortest between two points is based rather on the moment of a merely abstract identity possessing no difference within itself.</p>

Here it is immaterial which of the two numbers is called unit and which amount, whether we say four times three, where four is the amount and three is the unit, or conversely, three times four. We have already indicated above that the original finding of the product is effected by simple counting, that is, counting off on the fingers, etc.; the subsequent ability to state the product immediately rests on the collection of these products, on the multiplication table and on knowing it by heart.</p>

There are no other determinations in the Notion of number which could give rise to a difference; nor can there be any further equalising of the difference immanent in number. Where a number is raised to a higher power than the square the continuation is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal:</em>&nbsp;partly, with even exponents, there is only a repetition of squaring, and partly, with uneven powers, inequality again enters; to take the nearest example of the cube, although formally there is an equality of the new factor with both the amount and the unit, this factor is, as unit, unequal to the amount (the square, 3, against 3 times 3); this is still more evident in the cube Of 4 where the amount, 3, which indicates the number of times the unit is to be multiplied by itself, is different from the number itself standing for the unit. We have here in principle those determinations of amount and unit which, as the essential difference of the Notion, have to be equalised before number as a going-out-of-itself has completely returned into itself. The foregoing exposition also contains the reason why first, the solution of higher equations must consist on their reduction to quadratics, and secondly, why equations with odd exponents can only be formally determined and, just when the roots are rational they cannot be found otherwise than by an imaginary expression, that is, by the opposite of that which the roots are and express. From what has been said, it is clear that the arithmetical square alone contains an immanent absolute determinedness; for which reason equations with further formal powers must be reduced to it, just as in geometry the right-angled triangle contains an immanent, absolute determinedness which is expounded in Pythagoras&#39; theorem, for which reason, too, all other geometrical figures must be reduced to it for their complete determination.</p>

However, philosophy must be able to distinguish what is an intrinsically self-external material; the progressive determining of it by the Notion can then take place only in an external manner, and its moments, too, can be only in the form peculiar to their externality, as here, equality and inequality. It is an essential requirement when philosophising about real objects to distinguish those spheres to which a specific form of the Notion belongs, that is, spheres in which the Notion has an actual existence; otherwise the peculiar nature of a subject matter which is external and contingent will be distorted by Ideas, and similarly these Ideas will be distorted and made into something merely formal. But here, the externality in which the moments of the Notion appear in this external material, number, is the appropriate form; since these moments exhibit the subject matter in its fixed differences, and since, too, they contain no demand for speculative thinking and therefore appear easy, they deserve to be employed in text books of the elements.</p>

From an educational point of view, number has been regarded as the most suitable object of inner intuition and arithmetical operations with number have been held to be the mental activity in which mind brings to view its most characteristic relationships and in general, the fundamental relationships of essence. How far number can claim this high worth is evident from its Notion as now before us.</p>

Arithmetic is an analytical science because all the combinations and differences which occur in its subject matter are not intrinsic to it but are effected on it in a wholly external manner. It does not have a concrete subject matter possessing inner, intrinsic, relationships which, as at first concealed, as not given in our immediate acquaintance with them, have first to be elicited by the efforts of cognition. Not only does it not contain the Notion and therefore no problem for speculative thought, but it is the antithesis of the Notion. Because of the indifference of the factors in combination to the combination itself in which there is no necessity, thought is engaged here in an activity which is at the same time the extreme externalisation of itself, an activity in which it is forced to move in a realm of thoughtlessness and to combine elements which are incapable of any necessary relationships. The subject matter is the abstract thought of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality itself.</em></p>

This is why we see number used for the expression of philosophemata early on in the history of philosophy. It forms the latest stage in that imperfection which contemplates the universal admixed with sense. The ancients were clearly aware that number stands midway between sense and thought. Aristotle quotes Plato as saying that the mathematical determinations of things stand apart from and midway between the world of the senses and the Ideas; they are distinguished from the former by being invisible (eternal) and unmoved, and from the latter by being a many and a like, where as the Idea is purely self-identical and within itself a one. A more detailed and profound reflection on this subject by Moderatus of Cadiz is quoted in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Malchi Vita Pythagorae.&nbsp;</em>That the Pythagoreans hit on numbers he ascribes to their inability to apprehend&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clearly in reason&nbsp;</em>fundamental ideas and first principles, because these are hard to think and hard to express; numbers serve well as designations in instruction; in this among other things the Pythagoreans imitated the geometers who cannot express what is corporeal in thoughts and therefore use figures, saying &#39;this is a triangle&#39;, by which they do not mean that the visible drawing is to be taken for the triangle but only that it is a representation of the thought of it. Thus the Pythagoreans expressed the thought of unity, of self-sameness and equality and the ground of agreement, of connection and the sustaining of everything, of the self-identical, as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one.&nbsp;</em>It is superfluous to remark that the Pythagoreans passed on from numbers to thought as a medium of expression, to the express categories of like and unlike, of limit and infinity; even in respect of these numerical expressions it is reported that the Pythagoreans distinguished between the Monas and the one ; the Monas they took as the thought, but the one as the number, and similarly, they took two for the arithmetical term and the Dyas (for this is what it seems to mean there) for the thought of the indeterminate. These ancients at the outset perceived quite correctly the inadequacy of number forms for thought determinations and equally correctly they further demanded in place of this substitute for thoughts the characteristic expression; how much more advanced they were in their thinking than those who nowadays consider it praiseworthy, indeed profound, to revert to the puerile incapacity which again puts in the place of thought determinations numbers themselves and number-forms like powers, the infinitely great, the infinitely small, one divided by infinity, and other such determinations, which are themselves often only a perverted mathematical formalism.</p>

The difficulty in comprehending that, for example, one is three and three is one, stems from the fact that one is devoid of all relation and therefore does not in its own self exhibit the determination through which it passes into its opposite; on the contrary, one is essentially a sheer excluding and rejection of such a relation. Conversely, understanding makes use of this to combat speculative truth (as, for example, against the truth laid down in the doctrine called the trinity) and it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">counts&nbsp;</em>the determinations of it which constitute one unity, in order to expose them as sheer absurdity &mdash; that is, understanding itself commits the same absurdity of making that which is pure relation into something devoid of all relation. When the trinity was so named it was not reckoned that understanding would consider the one and number to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential deter</em>minateness of its content. This name expresses contempt for the understanding, which has nevertheless&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">confirmed itself in its conceit&nbsp;</em>of clinging to the one and number as such, and has set it up against reason.</p>

Whatever profound wisdom may be supposed to lie in such meagre symbols or in those richer products of fantasy in the mythology of peoples and in poetry generally, it is properly for thought alone to make explicit for consciousness the wisdom that lies only in them; and not only in symbols but in nature and in mind. In symbols the truth is dimmed and veiled by the sensuous element; only in the form of thought is it fully revealed to consciousness: the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">meaning&nbsp;</em>is only the thought itself.</p>

In the concrete philosophical sciences philosophy must take the logical element from logic, not from mathematics; it can only be an expedient of philosophical incapacity which, instead of going to philosophy for the logical element, has recourse to the shapes assumed by the logical element in other sciences, many of which shapes are only adumbrations of that element, others even defective forms of it. Apart from this, the mere application of such borrowed forms is an external procedure; the application itself must be preceded by an awareness not only of their meaning but of their value, too, and such awareness can come only from reflecting on them, not from the authority of mathematics. But logic itself is such awareness and it strips these forms of their particularity which it renders superfluous and unnecessary; it is logic which rectifies these forms and alone procures for them their justification, meaning and value.</p>

Number is a non-sensuous object, and occupation with it and its combinations is a non-sensuous business; in it mind is held to communing with itself and to an inner abstract labour, a matter of great though one-sided importance. For, on the other hand, since the basis of number in only an external, thoughtless difference, such occupation is an unthinking, mechanical one. The effort consists mainly in holding fast what is devoid of the Notion and in combining it purely mechanically. The content is the empty one; the substantial content of moral and spiritual life in its various forms on which, as the noblest aliment, education should nurture the young mind, is to be supplanted by the blank one or unit; when such exercise is made the prime interest and occupation, the only possible outcome must be to dull the mind and to empty it of both form and substance. Calculation being so much an external and therefore mechanical business, it has been possible to construct machines which perform arithmetical operations with complete accuracy. A knowledge of just this one fact about the nature of calculation is sufficient for an appraisal of the idea of making calculation the principal means for educating the mind and stretching it on the rack in order to perfect it as a machine.</p>

Extensive magnitude has the moment of continuity present within itself and in its limit, for its many is altogether continuous; the limit as negation appears, therefore, in this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality&nbsp;</em>of the many as a limiting of the oneness.

Similarly, a discrete magnitude is immediately only a differentiated many in general; were this as such supposed to have a limit, it would be only an aggregate, that is, would be only indefinitely limited; before it can be a specific quantum, the many must be compressed into a one and thereby posited as identical with the limit. Continuous and discrete magnitude, taken simply as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quanta&nbsp;</em>have each posited in it only one of the two sides which together make quantum fully determined and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">number.&nbsp;</em>This latter is immediately an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive quantum &mdash; the simple&nbsp;</em>determinateness which is essentially an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount,&nbsp;</em>but an amount of one and the same unit; extensive quantum is distinguished from number only by this, that in number the determinateness is expressly posited as a plurality.</p>

This externality, as simply a plurality, collapses into undifferentiatedness and sublates itself in the numerical one, in its self-relation. Quantum, however, has its determinateness as an amount; it contains this, as we have already seen, even though the amount is no longer posited in it. Degree, therefore, which, as in its own self unitary, no longer has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within&nbsp;</em>itself this external otherness, has it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>itself and relates itself to it as to its determinateness. A plurality external to the degree constitutes the determinateness of the simple limit which the degree is for itself. In extensive quantum amount, in so far as it was supposed to be present in the number, was so only as sublated; now it is determined as placed outside the number. Number as a one, being posited as self-relation reflected into itself, excludes from itself the indifference and externality of the amount and is self-relation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as relation through itself to an externality.</em></p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>of the determinateness constitutes its quality, that is, the determinateness which is in its own self a self-external determinateness. Accordingly, degree is a unitary quantitative determinateness among a plurality of such intensifies which, though differing from each other, each being only a simple self-relation, are at the same time essentially interrelated so that each has its determinateness in this continuity with the others. This relation of degree through itself to its other makes ascent and descent in the scale of degrees a continuous progress, a flux, which is an uninterrupted, indivisible alteration; none of the various distinct degrees is separate from the others but each is determined only through them. As a self-related determination of quantity, each degree is indifferent to the others; but it is just as much implicitly related to this externality, it is only through this externality that it is what it is; its relation to itself is, in short, the non-indifferent relation to externality, and in this it has its quality.</p>

Intensive magnitude is primarily a unitary one of a plurality; there are many degrees, but they are determined neither as a simple one nor as a plurality, but only in the relation of this self-externality, or in the identity of the one and the plurality. if, therefore, the many as such are indeed outside the simple, unitary degree, nevertheless the determinateness of the degree consists in its relation to them; it thus contains amount. just as twenty, as an extensive magnitude, contains the twenty ones as discrete within it, so does the specific degree contain them as the continuity which this determinate plurality simply is; it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">twentieth&nbsp;</em>degree, and is the twentieth degree only by virtue of this amount, which as such is outside it.</p>

Intensive magnitude is determined&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by other</em>intensive quanta and is continuous with its otherness, so that its determinateness consists in this relation to its otherness. Now in the first place, in so far as it is a simple determinateness it is determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively&nbsp;</em>to other degrees; it excludes them from itself and has its determinateness in this exclusion. But, secondly, it is determinate in its own self; this it is in the amount as its own amount, not in the amount as excluded, nor in the amount of other degrees. The twentieth degree contains the twenty within itself; it is not only determined as distinguished from the nineteenth, twenty-first, and so on, but its determinateness is its own amount. But in so far as the amount is its own &mdash; and the determinateness is at the same time essentially an amount &mdash; the degree is an extensive quantum.</p>

In addition, we have the conception of a philosophical science of Nature in which what is a plurality or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive</em>&nbsp;&mdash; for example, in the fundamental property of matter to occupy space, and in other concepts too &mdash; is converted into something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive,</em>&nbsp;meaning thereby that the intensive aspect as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dynamic&nbsp;</em>is the true determination; density, or the specific filling of space, for example, must essentially be understood not as a certain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate and amount&nbsp;</em>of material parts in a quantum of space, but as a certain degree of the space-filling force of matter.</p>

In what has been called the conversion of the mechanical into the dynamic point of view, there occurs the concept of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separately existing, independent parts,&nbsp;</em>which are only externally combined into a whole, and the concept of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">force&nbsp;</em>which is distinct from this. In the occupation of space, what is regarded on the one hand as only an aggregate of atoms external to one another, is on the other hand regarded as the expression of an underlying simple force. But these relations of whole and parts, of force and its expression, which here stand opposed to each other, do not belong in this section; they will be considered in their proper place later on. But this much may be remarked here, that though the relation of force and its expression which corresponds to intensive magnitude is in the first instance truer than that of whole and parts, yet this does not make force, as intensive, any less one-sided;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also expression,&nbsp;</em>the externality of extensive magnitude, is equally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inseparable&nbsp;</em>from force; so that one<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and the same content&nbsp;</em>is equally present in the two forms, both in intensive and in extensive magnitude.</p>

Number itself necessarily has this double form immediately within it. It is an amount in so far as it is an extensive magnitude; but number is also one, a ten, a hundred, and as such it is on the threshold of transition into an intensive magnitude, seeing that in this unity the plurality has become simple. One is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>an extensive magnitude, it can be represented as an arbitrary amount of parts. Thus the tenth, the hundredth, is this simple, intensive magnitude which has its determinateness in the plurality lying outside it, that is, in extensive magnitude. Number is a ten, a hundred and at the same time the tenth, hundredth, in the system of numbers; both are the same determinateness.</p>

As a mere spatial magnitude, the degree of the circle is only an ordinary number; taken as degree, it is intensive magnitude which has a meaning only as determined by the amount of degrees into which the circle is divided, just as number generally has meaning only in the number series.</p>

Thus, for example, a mass as weight is an extensive magnitude, in so far as it constitutes an amount of pounds, hundredweights, etc., and an intensive magnitude in so far as it exerts a certain pressure; the magnitude of the pressure is a simple number, a degree, which is specified by its place in a scale of degrees. As exerting pressure, mass is manifested as a being-within-self, as a subject to which belongs a difference of intensive magnitude. Conversely, that which exerts this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of pressure is capable of displacing a certain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount of</em>&nbsp;pounds, etc., and its magnitude is measured by this.</p>

But this degree is equally present as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive&nbsp;</em>magnitude, as the expansion of a fluid, of mercury in a thermometer, of air, or sound, and so on. A higher degree of temperature expresses itself as a longer column of mercury, or as a narrower sound cylinder; it heats a larger space in the same way as a lower degree heats only a smaller space.</p>

In his criticism of metaphysical propositions about the soul, which he calls paralogisms of pure reason, he comes to consider the inference from the simplicity of the soul to its permanence&#39; He counters this argument by saying &#39;that even if we admit the simple nature of the soul since, namely, it does not contain a plurality of separate parts and therefore no extensive magnitude, yet we cannot deny to it, any more than to any other existent thing, an intensive magnitude, that is, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of reality in respect of all its faculties, indeed, in respect of all that constitutes its existence; this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>can diminish through all the infinitely many smaller degrees so that although the postulated substance cannot be reduced to nothing by division (into parts), it can be so reduced by a gradual lessening&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(remissio</em>) of its powers. For&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consciousness</em>&nbsp;itself has, at any moment, a degree which can always be diminished, and the same must therefore also be true of its faculty of being aware of itself and thus of all the other faculties. In rational psychology, which is an abstract metaphysics, the soul is considered not as spirit but as a merely immediate being, as a soul thing. Kant thus has the right to apply the category of quantum to it &#39;as to any other existent thing&#39;, and in so far as this immediate being is determined as simple, to apply to it the category of intensive quantum.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Being&nbsp;</em>does, of course, belong to spirit, but its intensity is wholly different from that of intensive quantum; indeed, its intensity is such that in it the form of merely immediate being and all its categories are sublated. What should have been admitted was the elimination not only of the category of extensive quantum but that of quantum altogether. But a further advance has still to be made, namely, to understand how existence, consciousness, finitude, is in the eternal nature of spirit and proceeds from it without spirit thereby becoming a thing.</p>

But in general quantum is determinateness posited as sublated, the indifferent limit, the determinateness which is equally the negation of itself. In extensive magnitude this difference is developed; but intensive magnitude is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>of this externality which quantum is within itself. This difference, as internally self-contradictory, is posited as being the simple,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related</em>&nbsp;determinateness which is the negation of itself, having its determinateness not within itself but in another quantum.</p>

Quantum is an ought-to-be; it is by implication determined as being for itself, and this being-determined-for-itself is rather the being-determined-in-an-other, and, conversely, it is the sublation of being-determined-in-an-other, is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>subsisting for itself.</p>

The quantum is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite,</em>&nbsp;in the first place simply as limited, and secondly, as impelled beyond itself, as being determined in an other. But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity</em>&nbsp;of quantum is first, its unlimitedness, and secondly, its returnedness into itself, its indifferent being-for-self. If we now compare these moments with each other, we find that the determination of the finitude of quantum, the impulse to go beyond itself to an other in which its determination lies, is equally the determination of the infinite; the negation of the limit is the same impulsion beyond the determinateness, so that in this negation, in the infinite, quantum possesses its final determinateness. The other moment of infinity is the being-for-self which is indifferent to the limit; but the limiting of quantum itself is such that quantum is explicitly indifferent to its limit, and hence to other quanta and to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond.&nbsp;</em>In quantum, finitude and infinity (the spurious infinity supposedly separate from the finite) each already has within it the moment of the other.</p>

It is the reciprocal determining of the finite and infinite which was considered in the sphere of quality, with the difference that, as just remarked, in the sphere of quantity the limit in its own self dispatches and continues itself into its beyond and hence, conversely, the quantitative infinite too is posited as having quantum within it; for quantum in its self-externality is also its own self, its externality belongs to its determination.</p>

As at first posed, it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">problem</em>&nbsp;of attaining the infinite, not the actual reaching of it; it is the perpetual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generation&nbsp;</em>of the infinite, but it does not get beyond quantum, nor does the infinite become positively present. It belongs to the Notion of quantum to have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>of itself. This beyond is first, the abstract moment of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being&nbsp;</em>of quantum: the vanishing of quantum is its own act; it is thus related to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>as to its infinity, in accordance with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>moment of the opposition. Secondly, however, quantum is continuous with its beyond; quantum consists precisely in being the other of itself, in being external to itself; this externality is, therefore, no more an other than quantum itself; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>or the infinite is, therefore, itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a quantum.&nbsp;</em>In this way, the beyond is recalled from its flight and the infinite is attained. But because the infinite now affirmatively present is again a quantum, what has been posited is only a fresh limit; this, too, as a quantum, has again fled from itself, is as such beyond itself and has repelled itself into its non-being, into its own beyond, and as it thus repels itself into the beyond, so equally does the beyond perpetually become a quantum.</p>

Since both still bear the character of quantum they remain alterable, and the absolute determinateness which would be a being-for-self is, therefore, not attained. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-externality of</em>&nbsp;the determination is posited in the dual infinite &mdash; which is opposed to itself as a &#39;more&#39; and a &#39;less&#39; &mdash; in the infinitely great and infinitely small. In each, the quantum is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">maintained&nbsp;</em>in perpetual opposition to its beyond. No matter how much the quantum is increased, it shrinks to insignificance; because quantum is related to the infinite as to its non-being, the opposition is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative; the</em>&nbsp;increased quantum has therefore gained nothing from the infinite, which is now, as before, the non-being of quantum. In other words, the increase of quantum brings it no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nearer&nbsp;</em>to the infinite; for the difference between quantum and its infinity is essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not&nbsp;</em>a quantitative difference. The expression &#39;the infinitely great&#39; only throws the contradiction into sharper relief; it is supposed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">great,&nbsp;</em>that is, a quantum, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite,&nbsp;</em>that is, not a quantum. Similarly, the infinitely small is, as small, a quantum, and therefore remains absolutely, that is, qualitatively, too great for the infinite and is opposed to it. In both, there remains the contradiction of the infinite progress which in them should have reached its goal.</p>

It is true that in the quantitative progress the movement is not simply towards an abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>in general, but towards an explicitly different quantum; but this remains in the same way opposed to its negation. The progress, too, is therefore not a real advance but a repetition of one and the same thing, a positing, a sublating, and then again a positing and again a sublating, an impotence of the negative, for what it sublates is continuous with it, and in the very act of being sublated returns to it. Thus there are two terms, the bond between which is such that they simply flee from each other; and in fleeing from each other they cannot become separated but are joined together even in their flight from each other.</p>

This progression has often been the theme of tirades which have been admired as sublime productions. As a matter of fact, however, this modern sublimity does not magnify the object &mdash; rather does this take flight &mdash; but only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>which assimilates such vast quantities. The hollowness of this exaltation, which in scaling the ladder of the quantitative still remains subjective, finds expression in its own admission of the futility of its efforts to get nearer to the infinite goal, the attainment of which must, indeed, be achieved by a quite different method.</p>

Imagination fails before this progress into the infinitely remote, where beyond the most distant world there is a still more distant one, and the past, however remote, has a still remoter past behind it, the future, however distant, a still more distant future beyond it; thought fails in the face of this conception of the immeasurable, just as a dream, in which one goes on and on down a corridor which stretches away endlessly out of sight, finishes with falling or fainting.&#39;</p>

What makes thought succumb, what causes falling and faintness, is nothing else but the wearisome repetition which makes a limit vanish, reappear, and then vanish again, so that there is a perpetual arising and passing away of the one after the other and of the one in the other, of the beyond in the here and now, and of the here and now in the beyond, giving only the feeling of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">impotence</em>&nbsp;of this infinite or this ought-to-be, which would be master of the finite and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cannot.</em></p>

But this pure ego, because it has fixed itself in its abstraction and emptiness, has determinate reality, the fulness of the universe of nature and mind, confronting it as a beyond. We are faced with that same contradiction which lies at the base of the infinite progress, namely a returnedness-into-self which is at the same time immediately an out-of-selfness, a relation to its other as to its non-being; and this relation remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a longing,&nbsp;</em>because on the one side is the unsubstantial, untenable void of the ego fixed as such by the ego itself, and on the other, the fulness which though negated remains present, but is fixed by the ego as its beyond.</p>

The just quoted antithesis of finite and infinite in the shape of the manifold world and the ego raised to its freedom, is primarily qualitative. The ego in its self-determining forthwith proceeds to determine nature and to liberate itself therefrom; it thus connects itself through itself with its other which, as an external reality, is manifold and quantitative. The relation to the quantitative becomes itself quantitative; the negative relation of the ego to it, the power of the ego over the non-ego, over sense and outer nature, is consequently so conceived that morality can and ought continually to increase, and the power of sense continually to diminish. But the perfect adequacy of the will to the moral law is placed in the unending progress to infinity, that is, is represented as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely unattainable&nbsp;</em>beyond, and this very unattainableness is supposed to be the true sheet-anchor and fitting consolation; for morality is supposed to be a struggle, but such it can be oily if the will is inadequate to the moral law which thus becomes a sheer beyond for it.</p>

The pure will has its own appropriate law which stands in an essential relationship to the sphere of sense; and nature and sense on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>side has laws which neither stem from nor are conformable to the will nor, although distinct from it, have they even in principle an essential connection with it but are determined independently, are finished and complete in themselves. At the same time, however, both are moments of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one and the same simple being,&nbsp;</em>the ego; the will is determined as the negative in relation to nature so that the will only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>in so far as there is a sphere distinct from it which it sublates, but with which it thereby comes into contact and by which it is itself affected. Nature itself and nature as the sensuous sphere of man, as an independent system of laws, is indifferent to limitation by an other; it preserves itself in this process of limitation, enters into the relation as an independent factor and limits the will of law just as much as this limits it. The two processes comprise a single act: the self-determining of the will with the sublating of the otherness of nature, and the positing of this otherness as continuing itself as a reality in the process of being sublated, so that the otherness is not sublated. The contradiction involved in this is not resolved in the infinite progress: on the contrary, it is represented and affirmed as unresolved and unresolvable; the conflict of morality and sense is represented as the ultimate, absolute relation.</p>

But since both members of the antithesis remain implied as qualitatively distinct, the fact is rather that each is straightway made indifferent to this alteration because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as quanta&nbsp;</em>that they are related to each other. Nature is determined by the ego, sense by the will of the good; the alteration produced in sense by the will is only a quantitative difference, one which leaves sense itself unchanged.</p>

In this exposition, the first axiom, ego = ego, is followed by a second, independent of it, the opposition of the non-ego; the relation between the two is also directly assumed as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative</em>difference, that is, the non-ego is partly determined by the ego, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">partly&nbsp;</em>not. In this way, the non-ego is continued into its non-being in such wise that in its non-being it remains opposed as something not sublated. Consequently, after the contradictions contained in this have been developed in the system, the final result is that relationship which formed the beginning: the non-ego remains an infinite obstacle, an absolute other; the final relation of the non-ego and the ego to each other is the infinite progress, a longing and aspiration &mdash; the same contradiction with which the system began.</p>

That all opposition is only quantitative was for some time a cardinal thesis of recent philosophy; the opposed determinations have the same nature, the same content; they are real sides of the opposition in so far as each of them has within it both determinations, both factors of the opposition, only that on one side one of the factors&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preponderates,&nbsp;</em>on the other side the other, that is, one of the factors, a material substance or activity, is present in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater quantity&nbsp;</em>or in an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intenser degree&nbsp;</em>in one side than in the other. But in so far as substances or activities are presupposed, the quantitative difference rather confirms and completes their externality and indifference to each other and to their unity. The difference of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute&nbsp;</em>unity is supposed to be only quantitative; the quantitative, it is true, is immediate, sublated determinateness, but only the imperfect, as yet only first, negation, not the infinite, not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>of the negation. When<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and thought&nbsp;</em>are represented as quantitative determinations of absolute substance they too, as quanta, become completely external to each other and unrelated as, in a subordinate sphere, do carbon, nitrogen, etc. It is a third, an external reflection, which abstracts from their difference and recognises their unity, but a unity which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner, implicit&nbsp;</em>only, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself.&nbsp;</em>This unity is, therefore, in fact conceived only as a first,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>unity, or only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>which in its quantitative difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">remains like</em>&nbsp;itself, but does not of itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posit&nbsp;</em>itself as like itself; hence it is not grasped as a negation of the negation, as an infinite unity. Only in the qualitative opposition does the posited infinitude, being-for-self, emerge and the quantitative determination itself pass over into the qualitative, as we shall presently find.</p>

The antinomy there considered contained the opposition of qualitative finitude and infinitude. In another, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>of the four cosmological antinomics, it is the conflict arising rather from the quantitative limit which is considered. I shall therefore proceed to examine this antinomy here.</p>

This antithesis could be considered equally well with reference to time and space themselves, for whether time and space are relations of things themselves or are only forms of intuition, the antinomy based on limitation or non-limitation in them is not affected thereby.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">The thesis is:</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;The world has a beginning in time and is also enclosed within spatial limits.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;The world has no beginning in time; therefore, up to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">any given point of time,&nbsp;</em>an eternity has elapsed and consequently an infinite series of successive states of things in the world has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away.&nbsp;</em>Now the infinity of a series consists precisely in the impossibility of ever&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completing&nbsp;</em>it by successive synthesis. Therefore an infinite world series which has passed away is impossible and consequently a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its existence &mdash; which was to be proved.&#39;</p>

To comprehend a spatially infinite world would require an infinite time and this time must be regarded as having already elapsed in so far as the world in space is to be regarded not as gradually coming to be but as completely given. But it was shown of time in the first part of the proof that it is impossible to assume an infinite time as elapsed.</p>

Namely, there is assumed some or any&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given point of time&nbsp;</em>up to which an eternity has elapsed (eternity here has only the trivial meaning of a simply endless time). Now a given point of time means nothing else than a definite limit in time. In the proof therefore, a limit of time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed&nbsp;</em>as actual; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that&nbsp;</em>is just what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was to be proved.</em>For the thesis is, that the world has a beginning in time.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">There is only this difference, that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assumed&nbsp;</em>limit of time is a now as end of the time already elapsed, but the limit which is to be proved is a now as beginning of a future. But this difference is immaterial. The now is taken as the point in which an infinite series of successive states of things in the world is supposed to have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away,&nbsp;</em>therefore as end, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>limit. If this now were considered to be merely a quantitative limit which flows on and which not only must be transcended but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as the transcending of itself, then the infinite time series would not have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away&nbsp;</em>in it, but would continue to flow on, and so the argument of the proof would vanish. On the other hand, if the point of time is assumed as a qualitative limit for the past, in which case it is also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning</em>for the future (for each point of time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>the connection of the past and the future), then it is also an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute,&nbsp;</em>that is, abstract<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning&nbsp;</em>for the future &mdash; and it was this that was to be proved. The fact that its future and this its beginning is already preceded by a past does not affect the argument; because this point of time is a qualitative limit &mdash; and that it is to be taken as qualitative is implied in the description of it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completed,&nbsp;</em>elapsed, and therefore as not continuing &mdash; therefore in it time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">broken&nbsp;</em>off and the past lacks a connection with this time which could only be called future with reference to that past and, consequently, without such connection is only time as such, which has an absolute beginning. But if &mdash; as is, then, the case &mdash; it were related to the past through the now, the given point of time, and were thus determined as a future, then this point of time, too, regarded from the other side, would not be a limit; the infinite time series would continue itself in what was called future and would not be, as was assumed,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completed.</em></p>

All that the proof does is to represent the absolute limit of time asserted in the thesis as a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given point of time,&nbsp;</em>and then straightway to assume it as a completed, that is, abstract point &mdash; a popular determination which sensuous conception readily lets pass as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit,&nbsp;</em>thus allowing as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assumption&nbsp;</em>in the proof what had been put forward as the thing to be proved.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;The world has no beginning and no limits in space but is infinite with reference both to time and space.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px;">&#39;The world has a beginning. Since the beginning is an existence preceded by a time in which the thing is not, there must have been a preceding time in which the world was not, that is, an empty time. Now no originating of anything is possible in an empty time; because no part of such a time possesses&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;and in preference to any other, any distinguishing condition of existence or non-existence. In the world, therefore, many groups of things can indeed begin, but the world itself can have no beginning and with respect to past time is infinite.&#39;</p>

That is, it first assumes a beyond of the existing world, an empty time; but it also equally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continues&nbsp;</em>the existence of the world beyond itself into this empty time which is thereby sublated, with the result that the existence of the world is continued into infinity. The world is an existence; the proof&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes&nbsp;</em>that this existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comes into being&nbsp;</em>and that the coming-to-be has an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antecedent condition&nbsp;</em>which is in time. But the antithesis itself consists in the very fact that there is no unconditioned existence, no absolute limit, but that the existence of the world always requires an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antecedent condition.&nbsp;</em>Thus, what was to be proved is found as an assumption in the proof. Further, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">condition&nbsp;</em>is sought in empty time, which means in effect that it is taken as temporal and therefore as an existence and as limited. Altogether, then, the assumption is made that the world as an existence presupposes another conditioned existence in time, and so on, therefore, to infinity.</p>

It is directly assumed that the spatially limited world exists in an empty space and is supposed to stand in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to it, that is, there must be a movement out beyond it &mdash; on the one hand into the void, into the beyond and non-being of the world, but on the other hand, in order that it be in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>&nbsp;with its beyond, that is,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continue&nbsp;</em>itself into it, the beyond must be imagined as filled with the existence of the world. The infinity of the world in space which is asserted in the antithesis is nothing else than, on the one hand, empty space, and on the other the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the world to it, that is, the continuity of the world in empty space or the filling of space &mdash; which contradiction, namely, space as simultaneously empty and also filled, is the infinite progress of existence in space. This very contradiction, the relation of the world to empty space, is directly made the basis of the proof.</p>

In point of fact it is spirit which is so strong that it can endure contradiction, but it is spirit, too, that knows how to resolve it. But the so-called world (whether it be called an objective, real world or, according to transcendental idealism, a subjective intuition and a sphere of sense determined by the categories of the understanding) is never and nowhere without contradiction, but it is unable to endure it and is, therefore, subject to coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be.</p>

Its truth is their unity in which they are, but only as moments. It is the resolution of the contradiction of which it is the expression, and its immediate significance is, therefore, the restoration of the Notion of quantity, namely, that quantity is an indifferent or external limit. In the infinite progress as such, the only reflection usually made is that every quantum, however great or small, must be capable of vanishing, of being surpassed; but not that this self-sublating of quantum, the beyond, the spurious infinite itself also vanishes.</p>

But we have seen that in this something more is present, the negation of the negation, or that which the infinite in truth is. We regarded this previously as the restoration of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantity; this restoration means in the first place, that its determinate being has received a more precise determination; we now have quantum determined in conformity with its Notion, which is different from quantum in its immediacy; externality is now the opposite of itself, posited as a moment of quantity itself &mdash; quantum is posited as having its determinateness in another quantum by means of its non-being, of infinity; that is, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively&nbsp;</em>that which it is. However, this comparison of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantum with its determinate being belongs more to our reflection, to a relationship which is not yet present here. The immediately following determination is that the quantum has reverted to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality,&nbsp;</em>is from now on qualitatively determined. For its peculiarity, its quality, is the externality, the indifference of the determinateness; and quantum is now posited as being in fact&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>in its externality, as self-related therein, in simple unity with itself, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively</em>&nbsp;determined. This qualitative moment is still more closely determined, namely as being-for-itself; for the self-relation to which it has attained has proceeded from mediation, from the negation of the negation. Quantum has infinity, self-determinedness, no longer outside it but within itself.</p>

Ultimately, the justifications are based on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correctness of the results&nbsp;</em>obtained with the aid of the said infinite, which correctness is proved on quite other grounds: but the justifications are not based on the clarity of the subject matter and on the operation through which the results are obtained, for it is even admitted that the operation itself is incorrect.</p>

Often, the science of mathematics can only defend itself against these objections by denying the competence of metaphysics, asserting that it has nothing to do with that science and does not have to trouble itself about metaphysical concepts so long as it operates consistently within its own sphere. Mathematics has to consider not what is true in itself but what is true in its own domain. Metaphysics, though disagreeing with the use of the mathematical infinite, cannot deny or invalidate the brilliant results obtained from it, and mathematics cannot reach clearness about the metaphysics of its own concept or, therefore, about the derivation of the modes of procedure necessitated by the use of the infinite.</p>

But mathematics, in the method of its infinite, finds a radical contradiction to that very method which is peculiar to itself and on which as a science it rests. For the infinitesimal calculus permits and requires modes of procedure which mathematics must wholly reject when operating with finite quantities, and at the same time it treats these infinite quantities as if they were finite and insists on applying to the former the same modes of operation which are valid for the latter; it is a cardinal feature in the development of this science that it has succeeded in applying to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendental deter</em>minations and their treatment the form of ordinary calculation.</p>

But in the first place, this does not apply to every result and the introduction of the infinite is not for the sole purpose of shortening the ordinary method but in order to obtain results which this method is unable to secure. Secondly, success does not by itself justify the mode of procedure. This procedure of the infinitesimal calculus shows itself burdened with a seeming inexactitude, namely, having increased finite magnitudes by an infinitely small quantity, this quantity is in the subsequent operation in part retained and in part ignored. The peculiarity of this procedure is that in spite of the admitted inexactitude, a result is obtained which is not merely fairly close and such that the difference can be ignored, but is perfectly exact. In the operation itself, however, which precedes the result, one cannot dispense with the conception that a quantity is not equal to nothing, yet is so inconsiderable that it can be left out of account. However, what is to be understood by mathematical determinateness altogether rules out any distinction of a greater or lesser degree of exactitude, just as in philosophy there can be no question of greater or less probability but solely of Truth. Even if the method and use of the infinite is justified by the result, it is nevertheless not so superfluous to demand its justification as it seems in the case of the nose to ask for a proof of the right to use it. For mathematical knowledge is scientific knowledge, so that the proof is essential; and even with respect to results it is a fact that a rigorous mathematical method does not stamp all of them with the mark of success, which in any case is only external.</p>

The consideration of these justifications and characteristics of the mathematical infinite which I shall undertake at some length in this Remark will at the same time throw the best light on the nature of the true Notion itself and show how this latter was vaguely present as a basis for those procedures.</p>

It is true that in this definition the true Notion is not expressed but only, as already remarked, the same contradiction which is present in the infinite progress; but let us see what is implicitly contained in it. In mathematics a magnitude is defined as that which can be increased or diminished; in general, as an indifferent limit. Now since the infinitely great or small is that which cannot be increased or diminished, it is in fact no longer a quantum as such.</p>

But it is just the reflection that quantum (and in this remark quantum as such, as we find it, I call finite quantum) is sublated, which is usually not made, and which creates the difficulty for ordinary thinking; for quantum in so far as it is infinite is required to be thought as sublated, as something which is not a quantum but yet retains its quantitative character.</p>

But our concept of an infinite whole does not represent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">how great&nbsp;</em>it is and it is not therefore the concept of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">maximum&nbsp;</em>(or a minimum); this concept rather expresses only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the whole to an arbitrarily assumed unit, with respect to which the relation is greater than any number. According as this assumed unit is greater or smaller, the infinite would be greater or smaller. The infinity, however, since it consists solely in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to this given unit, would always remain the same, although of course the absolute magnitude of the whole would not be known through it.&#39;</p>

The maximum or minimum as such still appears as a quantum, an amount. Such a conception cannot avert the conclusion, adduced by Kant, which leads to a greater or lesser infinite. And in general, so long as the infinite is represented as a quantum, the distinction of greater or less still applies to it. This criticism does not however apply to the Notion of the genuine mathematical infinite, of the infinite difference, for this is no longer a finite quantum.</p>

A quantum as such is presupposed as given; by synthesising the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit</em>&nbsp;this is supposed to be converted into an amount, into a definite assignable quantum; but this synthesis, it is said, can never be completed. It is evident from this that we have here nothing but an expression of the progress to infinity, only represented&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendentally,&nbsp;</em>i.e. properly speaking, subjectively and psychologically. True, in itself the quantum is supposed to be completed; but transcendentally, namely in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>which gives it a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to a unit, the quantum comes to be determined only as incomplete and as simply burdened with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond.&nbsp;</em>Here, therefore, there is no advance beyond the contradiction contained in quantity; but the contradiction is distributed between the object and the subject, limitedness being ascribed to the former, and to the latter the progress to infinity, in its spurious sense, beyond every assigned determinateness.</p>

In the first place, as regards the true infinite quantum, it was characterised as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>infinite; it is such because, as we have seen, the finite quantum or quantum as such and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond,&nbsp;</em>the spurious infinite, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equally&nbsp;</em>sublated.

Such fraction, 2/7 for example, is not a quantum like 1, 2, 3, etc.; although it is an ordinary finite number it is not an immediate one like the whole numbers but, as a fraction, is directly determined by two other numbers which are related to each other as amount and unit, the unit itself being a specific amount. However, if we abstract from this more precise determination of them and consider them solely as quanta in the qualitative relation in which they are here, then 2 and 7 are indifferent quanta; but since they appear here only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments,</em>&nbsp;the one of the other, and consequently of a third (of the quantum which is called the exponent), they directly count no longer simply as 2 and 7 but only according to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific relationship in</em>&nbsp;which they stand to each other. In their place, therefore, we can just as well put 4 and 14, or 6 and 21, and so on to infinity. With this, then, they begin to have a qualitative character. If 2 and 7 counted as mere quanta, then 2 is just 2 and nothing more, and 7 is simply 7; 4, 14, 6, 21 etc., are completely different from them and, as only immediate quanta, cannot be substituted for them. But in so far as 2 and 7 are not to be taken as such immediate quanta their indifferent limit is sublated; on this side therefore they contain the moment of infinity, since not only are they no longer merely 2 and 7, but their quantitative determinateness remains &mdash; but as one which is in itself qualitative, namely in accordance with their significance as moments in the ratio. Their place can be taken by infinitely many others without the value of the fraction being altered, by virtue of the determinateness possessed by the ratio.</p>

A comparison of the two expressions shows that one of them, the infinite series, represents the fraction no longer as a ratio but from that side where it is a quantum as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of units added together, as an amount. That the magnitudes of which it is supposed to consist as amount are in turn decimal fractions and therefore are themselves ratios, is irrelevant here; for this circumstance concerns the particular kind of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit&nbsp;</em>of these magnitudes, not the magnitudes as constituting an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount.&nbsp;</em>just as a multi-figured integer in the decimal system is reckoned essentially as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount,</em>&nbsp;and the fact that it consists of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">products&nbsp;</em>of a number and of the number ten and powers of ten is ignored.

In representing the genuine mathematical infinite,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the form of series&nbsp;</em>was used originally and it has recently again been invoked; but this form is not necessary for it. On the contrary, the infinite of the infinite series is essentially different from the genuine infinite as the sequel will show. Indeed the form of infinite series is even inferior to the fractional expression.</p>

Thus the usually so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum,&nbsp;</em>the 2/7 or 1/(1 - a) is in fact a ratio; and this so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite expression&nbsp;</em>is the truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite expression</em>. The infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">series,&nbsp;</em>on the other hand, is in truth a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum;&nbsp;</em>its purpose is to represent in the form of a sum what is in itself a ratio, and the existing terms of the series are not terms of a ratio but of an aggregate. Furthermore, the series is in fact&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the finite expression;</em>&nbsp;for it is the incomplete aggregate and remains essentially deficient. According to what is really present in it, it is a specific quantum, but at the same time it is less than what it ought to be; and then, too, what it lacks is itself a specific quantum; this missing part is in fact that which is called infinite in the series, from the merely formal point of view that it is something lacking, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being</em>; with respect to its content it is a finite quantum. Only what is actually present in the series, plus what is lacking, together constitute the amount of the fraction, the specific quantum which the series also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought&nbsp;</em>to be but is not capable of being. The word&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite,&nbsp;</em>even as used in infinite series, is commonly fancied to be something lofty and exalted; this is a kind of superstition, the superstition of the understanding; we have seen how, on the contrary, it indicates only a deficiency.</p>

They contain a higher kind of infinity than do those which can be summed, namely an incommensurability, or the impossibility of representing the quantitative ratio contained in them as a quantum, even in the form of a fraction; but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of series&nbsp;</em>as such which they have contains the same determination of spurious infinity that is present in the series capable of summation.</p>

It will shed most light on his concept if I follow up this exposition with what he says on the subject.</p>

That is to say, the absolute affirmation of an existence is to be taken as its relation to itself, its not being dependent on an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other;&nbsp;</em>the finite, on the other hand, is negation, a ceasing-to-be in the form of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>&nbsp;which begins<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>it. Now the absolute affirmation of an existence does not, it is true, exhaust the notion of infinity; this implies that infinity is an affirmation, not as immediate, but only as restored by the reflection of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>into itself, or as negation of the negative. But with Spinoza, substance and its absolute unity has the form of an inert unity, i.e. of a unity which is not self-mediated, of a fixity or rigidity in which the Notion of the negative unity of the self, i.e. subjectivity, is still lacking.</p>

It seems that he thought highly of this figure and of the concept which it was used to illustrate, making it the motto of his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ethics.&nbsp;</em>&#39;Mathematicians conclude&#39;, he says, &#39;that the inequalities possible in such a space are infinite, not from the infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount&nbsp;</em>of parts, for its size is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fixed and limited and&nbsp;</em>1 can assume larger and smaller such spaces, but because the nature of the fact surpasses every determinateness.&#39; It is evident that Spinoza rejects that conception of the infinite which represents it as an amount or as a series which is not completed, and he points out that here, in the space of his example, the infinite is not beyond, but actually present and complete; this space is bounded, but it is infinite &#39;because the nature of the fact surpasses every determinateness&#39;, because the determination of magnitude contained in it cannot at the same time be represented as a quantum, or in Kant&#39;s words already quoted, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">synthesis&nbsp;</em>cannot be completed to form a (discrete) quantum. How in general the opposition of continuous and discrete quantum leads to the infinite, will be shown in detail in a later Remark. Spinoza calls the infinite of a series the infinite of the imagination; on the other hand, the infinite as self-relation he calls the infinite of thought, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinitum actu.&nbsp;</em>It is, namely,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actu, actually&nbsp;</em>infinite because it is complete and present within itself. Thus the series 0.285714 ... or 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">+&nbsp;</em>a + a<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;+ a<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;... is the infinite merely of imagination or supposition; for it has no actuality, it definitely lacks something; on the other hand 2/7 or 1/(1 - a)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is actually</em>not only what the series is in its developed terms, but is, in addition, what the series lacks, what it only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought to be.&nbsp;</em>The 2/7 or 1/(1 - a) is equally a finite magnitude like Spinoza&#39;s space enclosed between two circles, with its inequalities, and can like this space be made larger or smaller. But this does not involve the absurdity of a larger or smaller infinite; for this quantum of the whole does not concern the relation of its moments,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the nature of the fact,&nbsp;</em>i.e. the qualitative determination of magnitude; what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually present&nbsp;</em>in the infinite series is equally a finite quantum, but it is also still deficient.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Imagination&nbsp;</em>on the contrary stops short at quantum as such and does not reflect on the qualitative relation which constitutes the ground of the existing incommensurability.</p>

Now in the sense that in the place, too, of x and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>of a function, there can be put an infinite, i.e. inexhaustible, multitude of numbers, a and b are just as much variable magnitudes as the said x and y. The expression &#39;variable magnitudes&#39; is therefore very vague and ill-chosen for those determinations of magnitude whose interest and manner of treatment lie in something quite distinct from their mere variability.</p>

In 2/7 or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>, 2 and 7 are each independent determinate quanta and the relation is not essential to them; a and b likewise are intended to represent quanta which remain what they are even outside the relation. And further, 2/7 and a/b are each a fixed quantum, a quotient; the ratio constitutes an amount, the unit of which is expressed by the denominator and the amount of these units by the numerator, or conversely; even if 4 and 14, and so on, are substituted for 2 and 7, the ratio, also as a quantum, remains the same. But now in the function&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>, for example, this is essentially changed; here, it is true that x and y can stand for definite quanta, but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;have a determinate quotient, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>. Hence not only are these&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>of the ratio&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>, not any determinate quanta, but, secondly, their ratio is not a fixed quantum (nor is such a quantum meant as in the case of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>), not a fixed quotient, but this quotient is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as a quantum,</em>&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variable.&nbsp;</em>But this is solely because x has a relation, not to y, but to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">square of y.&nbsp;</em>The relation of a magnitude to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power&nbsp;</em>is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum,&nbsp;</em>but essentially a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>relation; the power-relation is the feature which is to be regarded as the fundamental determination. But in the function of the straight line&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax, a&nbsp;</em>is an ordinary fraction and quotient; consequently this function is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formally&nbsp;</em>a function of variable magnitudes, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;here are what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;are in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;that is, they are not in that determination in which the differential and integral calculus considers them. On account of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">special&nbsp;</em>nature of the variable magnitudes in this mode of consideration, it would have been fitting to have introduced both a special name for them and other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symbols&nbsp;</em>than those generally used for unknown&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantities</em>&nbsp;in any finite equation, determinate or indeterminate; for there is an essential difference between those magnitudes and such quanta which are merely unknown, but are in themselves completely determined or are a definite range of determinate quanta. It is, too, only because of a lack of awareness of what constitutes the peculiar interest of higher analysis and of what has led to the need for and invention of the differential calculus, that functions of the first degree and the equation of the straight line are themselves included in the treatment of this calculus; such formalism originates partly, too, in the mistake of imagining that the intrinsically correct demand for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generalisation&nbsp;</em>of a method has been fulfilled when the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>determinateness on which the need for the calculus is based is omitted, as if in this domain we were concerned only with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variable magnitudes.&nbsp;</em>A great deal of formalism would, indeed, have been avoided if it had been perceived that the calculus is concerned not with variable magnitudes as such but with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relations of powers.</em></p>

But the quantitative determinateness remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as element&nbsp;</em>of the principle of the quanta, or, as has also been said, the quanta remain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in their first concept.</em></p>

Failure to recognise it was the result of incorrect ideas on the part of mathematicians themselves; but it is the inability to justify the object as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>which is mainly responsible for these attacks. But mathematics, as we remarked above, cannot evade the Notion here; for, as mathematics of the infinite, it does not confine itself to the finite determinateness of its objects (as in ordinary mathematics, which considers and relates space and number and their determinations only according to their finitude); on the contrary, when it treats a determination taken from ordinary mathematics, it converts it into an identity with its opposite, e.g. converting a curved line into a straight one, the circle into a polygon, etc. Consequently, the operations which it allows itself to perform in the differential and integral calculus are in complete contradiction with the nature of merely finite determinations and their relations and would therefore have to be justified solely by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion.</em></p>

But the truth is rather that that which has being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">solely&nbsp;</em>in the ratio is not a quantum; the nature of quantum is such that it is supposed to have a completely indifferent existence apart from its ratio, and its difference from another quantum is supposed not to concern its own determination; on the other hand the qualitative is what it is only in its distinction from an other. The said infinite magnitudes, therefore, are not merely comparable, but they exist only as moments of comparison, i.e. of the ratio.</p>

I eliminate here those determinations which belong to the idea of motion and velocity (from which, mainly, he took the name of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fluxions</em>) because in them the thought does not appear in its proper abstraction but as concrete and mixed with non-essential forms. Newton explains that he understands by these fluxions not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indivisibles&nbsp;</em>(a form which was used by earlier mathematicians, Cavalieri and others and which involves the concept of an intrinsically determinate quantum), but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing divisibles;&nbsp;</em>also not sums and ratios of determinate parts but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits (limites</em>)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of sums and ratios</em>. It may be objected that vanishing magnitudes do not have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final ratio,&nbsp;</em>because the ratio before it vanishes is not final, and when it has vanished is no longer a ratio. But by the ratio of vanishing magnitudes is to be understood not the ratio&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">before which and after which&nbsp;</em>they vanish, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with which&nbsp;</em>they vanish.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(quacum evanescunt</em>). Similarly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>ratio of nascent magnitudes is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with which&nbsp;</em>they become.</p>

However, what has been quoted shows that the concept put forward by Newton corresponds to the way in which infinite quantity resulted from the reflection of quantum into itself in the exposition above. By magnitudes is understood magnitudes in their vanishing, i.e. which are no longer quanta; also, not ratios of determinate parts, but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits of the ratio.&nbsp;</em>The meaning is, therefore, that with the vanishing of the quanta individually, the sides of the ratio, there also vanishes the ratio itself in so far as it is a quantum; the limit of the quantitative ratio is that in which it both is and is not, or, more precisely, in which the quantum has vanished, with the result that the ratio and its sides are preserved, the former only as a qualitative relation of quantity and the latter similarly as qualitative moments of quantity. Newton goes on to add that from the fact that there are final ratios of vanishing magnitudes, it must not be inferred that there are final magnitudes,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indivisibles.&nbsp;</em>For this would mean a leap again from the abstract ratio to its sides as supposedly having an independent value of their own as indivisibles outside their relation, as something which would be a one, something devoid of any relation at all.</p>

In other words,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final magnitudes&nbsp;</em>could have been taken to mean, as already said, indivisibles or ones. But the definition of the final ratio excludes the conception both of the indifferent one which is devoid of any relation, and of the finite quantum. If the required determination had been developed into the Notion of a quantitative determination which is purely a moment of the ratio, there would have been no need for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">decreasing without limit&nbsp;</em>into which Newton converts the quantum and which only expresses the progress to infinity, or for the determination of divisibility which no longer has any immediate meaning here.</p>

This purification of the quantitative ratio is thus analogous to grasping an empirical reality in terms of its Notion.

A&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generated magnitude</em>&nbsp;(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genita</em>) is a product or quotient, such as a root, rectangle, square, also the sides of rectangles and squares &mdash; in general, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite magnitude.</em>&nbsp;&#39;Such a magnitude being considered as variable, increasing or decreasing in ceaseless motion and flux, he gives its momentary increments or decrements the name of moments. But these are not to be taken for particles of a definite magnitude&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(particulae finitae</em>): such would not themselves be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments&nbsp;</em>but magnitudes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generated&nbsp;</em>from moments. Rather are they to be understood as the nascent principles&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or beginnings&nbsp;</em>of finite magnitudes.&#39; Here the quantum is distinguished from itself: as a product or a real being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Daseiendes</em>], and in its becoming (or as nascent), in its beginning and principle, that is to say, in its Notion, or, what is here the same thing, in its qualitative determination: in the latter the quantitative differences, the infinite increments or decrements, are only moments; only that which has becoming at its back has passed over into the indifference of determinate being and into externality, i.e. is quantum. But if on the one hand the philosophy of the true Notion must acknowledge these determinations of the infinite with respect to increments or decrements, on the other hand it must be observed that the very forms of increments etc. fall&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within&nbsp;</em>the category of immediate quantum and of the continuous progress to which we have referred; in fact the conceptions of increment, growth or increase of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>, and so on, are to be regarded as the fundamental vice in these methods &mdash; the permanent obstacle to disengaging the determination of the qualitative moment of quantity in its purity from the conception of the ordinary quantum.</p>

The nature of these magnitudes is supposed to be such that they may be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">neglected,&nbsp;</em>not only in comparison with finite magnitudes, but also their higher orders in comparison with their lower, and even the products of several in comparison with a single one. With Leibniz, this demand to neglect is more strikingly prominent than with previous inventors of methods relating to these infinitesimals in which this call to neglect also occurs. It is chiefly this call to neglect which, along with a gain in facility, has given this calculus the appearance of inexactitude and express incorrectness in its method of procedure. Wolf has tried to make this neglect intelligible in his own way of popularising things, i.e. by polluting the pure Notion and setting in its place incorrect sensuous conceptions. For example, he compares the neglect of infinitesimals of higher orders relatively to lower with the procedure of a surveyor who, in measuring the height of a mountain is no less accurate if meanwhile the wind has blown away a grain of sand from the top; or with the neglect of the height of houses or towers when calculating lunar eclipses.</p>

It is quite obvious that in the science of mathematics there cannot be any question of such empirical accuracy; mathematical measuring by operations of the calculus or by geometrical constructions and proofs is altogether different from land-surveying, from the measuring of empirical lines, figures etc. Besides, by comparing the result obtained by a strictly geometrical method with that obtained by the method of infinite differences, analysts demonstrate that the one is the same as the other and that there is absolutely no question of a greater or lesser degree of exactness. And it is self-evident that an absolutely exact result could not emerge from an inexact method. Yet on the other hand again, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method itself&nbsp;</em>cannot do without this omission of what is regarded as insignificant, despite its protestations against the way this omission is justified.

He adopts the general Newtonian definition and insists that the differential calculus considers the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratios of the increments&nbsp;</em>of a magnitude, but that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite difference&nbsp;</em>as such is to be considered as wholly nil. How this is to be understood is clear from the foregoing; the infinite difference is a nil only of quantum, not a qualitative nil, but as a nil of quantum it is a pure moment of the ratio only. It is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>difference; but for that reason it is, on the one hand, altogether wrong to speak of those moments which are called infinitesimals, also as increments or decrements and as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">differences.</em>This description implies that something is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">added to or subtracted from&nbsp;</em>the initially given finite magnitude, that a subtraction or addition, an arithmetical, external operation takes place. But it is to be noticed that the transition of the function of the variable magnitude into its differential is of a quite different nature; as we have made clear, it is to be considered as a reduction of the finite function to the qualitative relation of its quantitative determinations. On the other hand, the error becomes obvious when it is said that the increments by themselves are zeros, that only their ratios are considered; for a zero no longer has any determinateness at all. This conception then, does get as far as the negative of the quantum and gives definite expression to it, but at the same time it does not grasp this negative in its positive significance of qualitative determinations of quantity which, if they were torn out of the ratio and regarded as quanta, would be only zeros.</p>

And the understanding must, indeed, transcend this merely negative side on which the terms of the ratio are quantitatively zero, and must grasp them positively, as qualitative moments. But we cannot regard, as satisfactory Euler&#39;s further remarks with regard to this conception of his in which he tries to show that two so-called infinitesimals which are supposed to be nothing else but zeros, nevertheless stand in a relation to each other, for which reason they are denoted by symbols other than zero. He tries to base this on the difference between the arithmetical and geometrical ratio: in the former, we have an eye to the difference, in the latter, to the quotient, so that although in the former there is no difference between two zeros, this is not so in the geometrical ratio; if 2: 1 = 0 : 0 then from the nature of proportion it follows that, because the first term is twice as great as the second, the third is also twice as great as the fourth; thus according to proportion, 0 : 0 is to be taken as the ratio of 2 : 1. Even in common arithmetic n. 0 = 0 and therefore n : 1 = 0 : 0. But it is just because 2 : 1 or n : 1 is a relation of quanta that there cannot be any corresponding ratio or expression of 0 : 0.</p>

Consequently, in the actual application of the method of infinitesimals, the genuine Notion of the infinite cannot exercise any influence; on the contrary, there is a return of the finite determinateness of quantity and the operation cannot dispense with the conception of a quantum which is merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively small. The</em>&nbsp;calculus makes it necessary to subject the so-called infinitesimals to ordinary arithmetical operations of addition and so on, which are based on the nature of finite magnitudes, and therefore to regard them momentarily as finite magnitudes and to treat them as such. It is for the calculus to justify its procedure in which it first brings them down into this sphere and treats them as increments or differences, and then neglects them as quanta after it had just applied forms and laws of finite magnitudes to them.</p>

Lagrange speaks, e.g., of the method devised by Landen, saying that it is purely analytical and does not employ infinitesimal differences, but starts with different values of variable magnitudes and subsequently equates them. He also gives it as his opinion that in this method, the differential calculus loses its own peculiar advantages, namely simplicity of method and facility of operation. This is, indeed, a procedure which in some measure corresponds to the starting-point of Descartes&#39; tangential method of which detailed mention will be made later. This much, we may remark here, is generally evident, that the general procedure in which different values of variable magnitudes are assumed and subsequently equated, belongs to another department of mathematical treatment than that to which the method of the differential calculus itself belongs; and that the peculiar nature of the simple relation (to be considered in detail further on) to which its actual, concrete determination reduces, namely, of the derived function to the original, is not brought into prominence.</p>

This is for them the sole basis of the fundamental principle, namely the determination of that which is the differential of a product or a power,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for the entire theoretical teaching reduces to this.&nbsp;</em>The rest is partly the mechanism of development and partly application, in which however as we shall later on see, the more important, or rather the sole, interest is to be found. With respect to the present topic, we need only mention here what is elementary, that on the same ground of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">insignificance,&nbsp;</em>the cardinal principle adopted in relation to curves is that the elements of the curves, namely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increments</em>of abscissa and ordinate, have the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>&nbsp;to each other of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subtangent and ordinate;&nbsp;</em>for the purpose of obtaining similar triangles, the arc which forms the third side of a triangle to the two increments of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">characteristic triangle</em>&nbsp;(as it rightly used to be called), is regarded as a straight line, as part of the tangent and one of the increments therefore as reaching to the tangent. By these assumptions those determinations are, on the one hand, raised above the nature of finite magnitudes, but on the other hand, a method which is valid only for finite magnitudes and which does not permit the omission of anything on the ground of insignificance, is applied to moments now called infinitesimal. With such a mode of procedure, the difficulty which encumbers the method remains in all its starkness.</p>

He finds the differentials of products &mdash; from which the differentials of quotients, powers, etc., can then be easily derived &mdash; in the following way. The product of x and y, when each is taken as reduced by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">half&nbsp;</em>of its infinitesimal difference, becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xdy</em>/2 -&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx</em>/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxdy</em>/4; but if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;are made to increase by the same amount, it becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy</em>&nbsp;+ xdy/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx</em>/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxdy</em>/4. Now when the first product is subtracted from the second,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx + xdy</em>&nbsp;remains as a surplus and this is said to be the surplus of the increase by a whole dx and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>for this increase is the difference between the two products; it is therefore the differential of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy.&nbsp;</em>Clearly, in this procedure, the term which forms the chief difficulty, the product of the two infinitesimal differences, cancels itself out. But in spite of the name of Newton it must be said that such an operation although very elementary, is incorrect; it is not true that (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>/2) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/2) - (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x - dx</em>/2) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/2)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">=&nbsp;</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>) -&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy.&nbsp;</em>It can only have been the need to establish the all-important fluxional calculus which could bring a Newton to deceive himself with such a proof.</p>

Lagrange shows that Newton made the mistake because he omitted the term of the series containing that power on which the specific problem turned. Newton had kept to the formal, superficial principle of omitting terms on account of their relative smallness. For example, it is well known that in mechanics the terms of the series in which the function of a motion is developed are given a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific meaning,&nbsp;</em>so that the first term or the first function refers to the moment of velocity, the second to the accelerating force and the third to the resistance of forces. Here, then, the terms of the series are not to be regarded merely as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parts&nbsp;</em>of a sum, but rather as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative moments Of a whole determined by the concept.&nbsp;</em>In this way, the omission of the rest of the terms belonging to the spuriously infinite series acquires an altogether different meaning from omission on the ground of their relative smallness.</p>

The advantages of his functional calculus as regards precision, abstraction and generality, are sufficiently recognised; we need mention only what is pertinent here, that it rests on the fundamental principle that the difference, without becoming zero, can be assumed so small that each term of the series is greater than the sum of all the following terms. This method, too, starts from the categories of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of the function, the variable magnitude of which receives&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the increment,&nbsp;</em>thereby bringing in the troublesome series of the original function; also in the sequel the terms to be omitted are considered only as constituting a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum,&nbsp;</em>while the reason for omitting them is made to consist in the relativity of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum.&nbsp;</em>And so here, too, on the one hand, the principle of the omission is not brought back to the point of view exemplified in some applications, where (as was remarked above) terms of the series are supposed to have a specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>significance, and terms are neglected not because of their quantitative insignificance but because they are not qualitatively significant; and then, on the other hand, the omission itself has no place in the essential point of view which, as regards the so-called differential coefficient, only becomes specifically prominent with Lagrange, in the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application</em>&nbsp;of the calculus, as will be more fully considered in the following remark.</p>

Lagrange criticises this method as lacking case in application and he claims that the expression limit does not present any definite idea; this second point we will take up here and examine more closely what is stated about its analytical meaning. Now the idea of limit does indeed imply the true category of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively&nbsp;</em>determined relation of variable magnitudes above-mentioned; for the forms of it which occur,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>are supposed to be taken simply and solely as moments of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;itself must be regarded as a single indivisible symbol.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">That the mechanism of the calculus, especially in its application, thus loses the advantage it derived from the separation of the sides of the differential coefficient, this we will pass over here. Now the said limit is to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit&nbsp;</em>of a given function; it is to assign to this function a certain value determined by its mode of derivation. But with the mere category of limit we should not have advanced beyond the scope of this Remark, which is to demonstrate that the infinitely small which presents itself in the differential calculus as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,</em>does not have merely the negative, empty meaning of a non-finite, non-given magnitude, as when one speaks of &#39;an infinite multitude&#39;, &#39;to infinity&#39;, and the like, but on the contrary has the specific meaning of the qualitative nature of what is quantitative, of a moment of a ratio as such. This category, however, merely as such, still has no relation to that which is a given function and does not itself enter into the treatment of such a function or into the use to be made of that determination; thus the idea of limit, too, confined to this its demonstrated character, would lead nowhere. But the very expression &#39;limit&#39; implies that it is a limit of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something, i.e.</em>&nbsp;that it expresses a certain value which lies in the function of a variable magnitude; and we must examine the nature of this concrete role. It is supposed to be the limit of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>between the two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increments&nbsp;</em>by which the two variable magnitudes connected in an equation (one of which is regarded as a function of the other), are supposed to have been&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increased;&nbsp;</em>the increase is taken here as quite undetermined and so far no use is made of the infinitely small. But the way in which this limit is found involves the same inconsistencies as are contained in the other methods. This way is as follows: if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>=<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;fx</em>, then when y becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y + k, fx&nbsp;</em>is to change into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx + ph + qh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;and so on; thus<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k = ph + qh<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>,&nbsp;</em>etc., and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p + qh + rh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, etc. Now if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;vanish, the right-hand side of the equation also vanishes with the exception of p; now p is supposed to be the limit of the ratio of the two increments. It is clear that while h, as a quantum, is equated with 0,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;nevertheless is not at the same time equal to 0/0 but is supposed still to remain a ratio.</p>

The more precise meaning of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximation&nbsp;</em>with respect to the terms which are supposed really to approach each other will be considered later. But that a quantitative difference, the definition of which is that it not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can, but shall&nbsp;</em>be smaller than any given difference, is no longer a quantitative difference, this is self-evident, as self-evident as anything can be in mathematics; but we still have not got away from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;= 0. If on the other hand&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>, i. e. is assumed to be a definite quantitative ratio as in fact it is, then conversely there is a difficulty about the presupposition which equates h with o, a presupposition which is indispensable for obtaining the equation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>. But if it be granted that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;= 0, (and when&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;= 0,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>&nbsp;is in fact automatically = 0, for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>, the increment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>, depends entirely on the existence of the increment&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>), then the question would arise, what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;&mdash; which is a quite definite quantitative value &mdash; is supposed to be. To this there is at once an obvious answer, the simple, meagre answer that it is a coefficient derived in such and such a way &mdash; the first function, derived in a certain specific manner, of an original function. if we content ourselves with this &mdash; and Lagrange did, in fact, do so in practice &mdash; then the general part of the science of the differential calculus, and straightway this one particular form of it called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">theory of limits&nbsp;</em>would be rid of the increments and of their infinite or arbitrary smallness &mdash; spared too, the difficulty of getting rid again of all the terms of a series other than the first, or rather only the coefficient of the first, which inevitably follow on the introduction of these increments; in addition it would also be purged of those formal categories connected with them, especially of the infinite, of infinite approximation and, too, the categories, here equally empty, of continuous magnitude&#39; which, moreover, like&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nisus,&nbsp;</em>becoming, occasion of a variation, are deemed necessary.</p>

Into what formal definitions one may be led in these matters can be seen from the penetrating exposition by my respected colleague, Prof. Dirksen of the fundamental determinations used in the deduction of the differential calculus, which forms an appendix to the criticism of some recent works on this science. The following definition is actually quoted: &#39;A continuous magnitude, a continuum, is any magnitude thought of as in a state of becoming such that this becoming takes place not by leaps but by an uninterrupted progress&#39;.

As we have seen, it is in this that the entire nature of the matter consists. Thus in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final ratio,&nbsp;</em>for example, the quanta of abscissa and ordinate vanish; but the sides of this ratio essentially remain, the one an element of the ordinate, the other an element of the abscissa. This vanishing being represented as &#39; an infinite approximation, the previously distinguished ordinate is made to pass over into the other ordinate, and the previously distinguished abscissa into the other abscissa; but essentially this is not so, the ordinate does not pass over into the abscissa, neither does the abscissa pass into the ordinate. To continue with this example of variable magnitudes, the element of the ordinate is not to be taken as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference of one ordinate from another ordinate,&nbsp;</em>but rather as the difference or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>&nbsp;determination of magnitude relatively to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">element o the abscissa;</em>&nbsp;the principle of the one variable magnitude relatively to that of the other is in reciprocal relation with it. The difference, as no longer a difference of finite magnitudes, has ceased to be manifold within itself; it has collapsed into a simple intensity, into the determinateness of one qualitative moment of a ratio relatively to the other.</p>

And so the limit here does not have the meaning of ratio; it counts only as the final value to which another magnitude of a similar kind continually approximates in such a manner that it can differ from it by as little as we please, and that the final&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>is a ratio of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality.&nbsp;</em>The infinite difference is thus the fluctuation of a difference of one quantum from another quantum, and the qualitative nature according to which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;is essentially not a determination of the ratio relatively to x, but to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>comes to be overlooked.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Dx</em>&nbsp;is permitted to vanish relatively to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, but even more does&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;vanish relatively to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>; but this means in truth: it has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation only to dy.&nbsp;</em>In such expositions, geometricians are mainly concerned to make intelligible the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximation&nbsp;</em>of a magnitude to its limit and to keep to this aspect of the difference of quantum from quantum, how it is no difference and yet still is a difference. But all the same, approximation is a category which of itself says nothing and explains nothing; dx already has approximation behind it; it is neither near nor nearer; and &#39;infinitely near&#39;, itself means the negation of nearness and approximation.</p>

From this would follow the inadmissible idea that it is allowed in the final ratio to equate, say abscissa and ordinate, or even sine, cosine, tangent, versed sine, and what not. This idea seems at first to prevail when the arc is treated as a tangent; for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arc,&nbsp;</em>too, is certainly incom<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mensurable&nbsp;</em>with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">straight line,&nbsp;</em>and its element is, in the first place, of another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>than the element of the straight line. It seems even more absurd and inadmissible than the confusing of abscissa, ordinate, versed sine, cosine, etc., when&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quadrata rotundas,&nbsp;</em>when part of an arc, even though an infinitely small part, is taken to be a part of the tangent and so treated as a straight line. However, this treatment differs essentially from the confusion we have decried; it is justified by the circumstance that in the triangle which has for its sides the element of an arc and the elements of its abscissa and ordinate, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation is the same as</em>&nbsp;if this element of the arc were the element of a straight line, of the tangent; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">angles&nbsp;</em>which constitute the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential relation, i.e.</em>&nbsp;that which remains to these elements when abstraction is made from the finite magnitudes belonging to them, are the same. This can also be expressed as the transition of straight lines which are infinitely small, into curved lines, and their relation in their infinity as a relation of curves. Since, according to its definition, a straight line is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">shortest&nbsp;</em>distance between two points, its difference from the curved line is based on the determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount,&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">smaller</em>amount of what is differentiated in this manner, a determination, therefore, of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum.&nbsp;</em>But this determination vanishes in the line when it is taken as an intensive magnitude, as an infinite moment, as an element, and with it, too, its difference from the curved line which rested merely on the difference of quantum. As infinite, therefore, the straight line and arc no longer retain any quantitative relation nor consequently, on the basis of the assumed definition, any qualitative difference from each other either; on the contrary, the former passes into the latter.</p>

This proposition is the expression in words of what is supposed to be the significance of an analytical term obtained in the above-mentioned development of the formula relating to a motion which is non-uniform but otherwise conforms to a law. Earlier mathematicians sought to express in words and propositions and to exhibit in geometrical tables the results of the newly invented infinitesimal calculus (which moreover always had to do with concrete objects), chiefly in order to use them for theorems susceptible of the ordinary method of proof. The terms of a mathematical formula into which analytical treatment resolved&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the magnitude&nbsp;</em>of the object, of motion, for instance, acquired there an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective&nbsp;</em>significance, such as velocity, force of acceleration, and so on; in accordance with this meaning they were supposed to furnish correct propositions, physical laws; their objective connections and relations, too, were supposed to be determined in accordance with the analytical connection. A particular example is that in a uniformly accelerated motion there is supposed to exist a special velocity proportional to the times, but that to this velocity there constantly accrues an increment from the force of gravity.</p>

The difficulty of making intelligible the connection of such forms when they are taken in the real meaning alluded to, for example the transition from said simply uniform velocity to a uniformly accelerated velocity, is held to be completely eliminated by the analytical treatment in which such connection is a simple result of the authority now established once and for all of the operations of the calculus. It is announced as a triumph of science that by means of the calculus alone, laws are found<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcending experience,&nbsp;</em>that is, propositions about existence which have no existence. But in the earlier, still naive period of the infinitesimal calculus, the aim was to assign to those forms and propositions represented in geometrical diagrams a real meaning of their own and to make that meaning plausible, and to apply the forms and propositions bearing such meaning in the proof of the main propositions concerned.</p>

But 1 do not hesitate to regard this affectation as nothing more than mere jugglery and window-dressing, and I include in this description even Newton&#39;s proofs, especially those belonging to what has just been quoted, for which Newton has been extolled to the skies and exalted above Kepler, namely that he demonstrated mathematically what Kepler had discovered&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely empirically.</em></p>

But mathematics is altogether incapable of proving quantitative determinations of the physical world in so far as they are laws based on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative nature&nbsp;</em>of the moments [of the subject matter]; and for this reason, that this science is not philosophy, does&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not start from the Notion,&nbsp;</em>and therefore the qualitative element, in so far as it is not taken lemmatically from experience, lies outside its sphere. The desire to uphold the honour of mathematics, that all its propositions ought to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rigorously proved,&nbsp;</em>has often caused it to forget its limits; thus it seemed against its honour to acknowledge simply experience as the source and sole proof of empirical propositions. Consciousness has since then developed a more instructed view of the matter; so long, however, as consciousness is not clearly aware of the distinction between what is mathematically demonstrable and what can come only from another source, between what are only terms of an analytical expansion and what are physical existences, scientific method cannot be developed into a rigorous and pure attitude in this field. Without doubt, however, the same justice will be done to that framework of Newtonian proof as was done to another baseless and artificial Newtonian structure of optical experiments and conclusions derived from them. Applied mathematics is still full of a similar concoction of experiment and reflection; but just as one part after another of Newtonian optics long since began to be ignored in practice by the science &mdash; with the inconsistency however that all the rest although in contradiction was allowed to stand &mdash; so, too, it is a fact that already some of those illusory proofs have fallen into oblivion or have been replaced by others.</p>

The so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application,&nbsp;</em>however, presents greater difficulties, but also the more interesting side; the elements of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>side are to be the object of this Remark. The whole method of the differential calculus is complete in the proposition that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxn = nx</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">n</em>&nbsp;- 1)<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, or (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">f</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x + i</em>)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- fx</em>)/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i&nbsp;</em>=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">P</em>, that is, is equal to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficient&nbsp;</em>of the first term of the binomial&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x + d</em>, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x +&nbsp;</em>1, developed according to the powers of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx or&nbsp;</em>i. There is no need to learn anything further: the development of the next forms, of the differential of a product, of an exponential magnitude and so on, follows mechanically; in little time, in half an hour perhaps &mdash; for with the finding of the differential the converse the finding of the original function from the differential, or integration, is also given &mdash; one can be in possession of the whole theory. What takes longer is simply the effort to understand, to make intelligible, how it is that, after having so easily accomplished&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first stage&nbsp;</em>of the task, the finding of the said differential, analytically, i.e. purely arithmetically, by the expansion of the function of the variable after this has received the form of a binomial by the addition of an increment; how it is that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second stage&nbsp;</em>can be correct, namely the omission of all the terms except the first, of the series arising from the expansion. If all that were required were only this coefficient, then with its determination all that concerns the theory would, as we have said, be settled and done with in less than half an hour and the omission of the further terms of the series (with the determination of the first function, the determination of the second, third, etc., is also accomplished) far from causing any difficulty, would not come into question since they are completely irrelevant.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">We may begin by remarking that the method of the differential calculus shows on the face of it that it was not invented and constructed for its own sake. Not only was it not invented for its own sake as another mode of analytical procedure; on the contrary, the arbitrary omission of terms arising from the expansion of a function is absolutely contrary to all mathematical principles, it being arbitrary in the sense that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>of this development is nevertheless assumed to belong&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely&nbsp;</em>to the matter in hand, this being regarded as the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>between the developed function of a variable (after this has been given the form of a binomial) and the original function. The need for such a mode of procedure and the lack of any internal justification at once suggest that the origin and foundation must lie elsewhere. It happens in other sciences too, that what is placed at the beginning of a science as its elements and from which the principles of the science are supposed to be derived is not self-evident, and that it is rather in the sequel that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">raison d&#39;&eacute;tre&nbsp;</em>and proof of those elements is to be found. The course of events in the history of the differential calculus makes it plain that the matter had its origin mainly in the various so-called tangential methods, in what could be considered ingenious devices; it was only later that mathematicians reflected on the nature of the method after it had been extended to other objects, and reduced it to abstract formulae which they then also attempted to raise to the status of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle</em>.</p>

This was done only in the interest of the abstract nature of the notion as such; the next question would be as to the nature of the transition from this to the mathematical formulation and application. To this end we must first pursue our examination of the theoretical side, the specific nature of the notion, which will not prove wholly unfruitful in itself; we must then consider the relation of the theoretical side to its application; and in both cases we must demonstrate, so far as it is relevant here, that the general conclusions are at the same time adequate to the purpose of the differential calculus and to the way in which the calculus brings about its results.</p>

The specifically qualitative character of quantity is first indicated in the quantitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>as such; but it was already asserted in anticipation when demonstrating the so-called kinds of reckoning (see the relative Remark), that it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of powers</em>(still to be dealt with in its proper place) in which number, through the equating of the moments of its Notion, unit and amount, is posited as returned into itself, thereby receiving into itself the moment of infinity, of being-for-self, i.e. of being self-determined. Thus, as we have already said, the express qualitative nature of quantity is essentially connected with the forms of powers, and since the specific interest of the differential calculus is to operate with qualitative forms of magnitude, its own peculiar subject matter must be the treatment of forms of powers, and the whole range of problems, and their solutions, show that the interest lies solely in the treatment of determinations of powers as such.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">This foundation is important and at once puts in the forefront something definite in place of the merely formal categories of variable, continuous or infinite magnitudes or even of functions generally; yet it is still too general, for other operations also have to do with determinations of powers. The raising to a power, extraction of a root, treatment of exponential magnitudes and logarithms, series, and equations of higher orders, the interest and concern of all these is solely with relations which are based on powers. Undoubtedly, these together constitute a system of the treatment of powers; but which of the various relations in which determinations of powers can be put is the peculiar interest and subject matter of the differential calculus, this is to be ascertained from the calculus itself, i.e. from its so-called applications. These are, in fact, the core of the whole business, the actual procedure in the mathematical solution of a certain group of problems; this procedure was earlier than the theory or general part and was later called application only with reference to the subsequently created theory, the aim of which was to draw up the general method of the procedure and, as well, to endow it with first principles, i.e. with a justification. We have shown in the preceding Remark the futility of the search for principles which would clarify the method as currently understood, principles which would really solve the contradiction revealed by the method instead of excusing it or covering it up merely by the insignificance of what is here to be omitted (but which really is required by mathematical procedure), or, by what amounts to the same thing, the possibility of infinite or arbitrary approximation and the like. If from the practical part of mathematics known as the differential calculus the general features of the method were to be abstracted in a manner different from that hitherto followed, then the said principles and the concern about them would also show themselves to be superfluous, just as they reveal themselves to be intrinsically false and permanently contradictory.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;"><span class="pointa" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(a)</span>&nbsp;Equations in which any number of magnitudes (here we can simply confine ourselves to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two</em>) are combined into a qualitative whole in such a way that first, these equations have their determinateness in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirical magnitudes&nbsp;</em>which are their fixed limits, and also in the kind of connection they have with these limits and with each other as is generally the case in an equation; but since there is only one equation for both magnitudes (similarly, relatively more equations for more magnitudes, but always fewer than the number of magnitudes), these equations belong to the class of indeterminate equations; and secondly, that one aspect of the determinateness of these magnitudes is that they are &mdash; or at least one of them is present in the equation in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">higher power&nbsp;</em>than the first.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">Before proceeding further, there are one or two things to be noticed about this. The first is that the magnitudes, as described under the first of the above two headings, have simply and solely the character of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variables&nbsp;</em>such as occur in the problems of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate</em>analysis. Their value is undetermined, but if one of them does receive a completely determined value, i.e. a numerical value, from outside, then the other too, is determined, so that one is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">function&nbsp;</em>of the other. Therefore, in relation to the specific quantitative determinateness here in question, the categories of variable magnitudes, functions and the like are, as we have already said, merely formal, because they are still too general to contain that specific element on which the entire interest of the differential calculus is focused, or to permit of that element being explicated by analysis; they are in themselves simple, unimportant, easy determinations which are only made difficult by importing into them what they do not contain in order that this may then be derived from them &mdash; namely, the specific determination of the differential calculus. Then as regards the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant,&nbsp;</em>we can note that it is in the first place an indifferent empirical magnitude determining the variables only with respect to their empirical quantum as a limit of their minimum and maximum; but the nature of the connection between the constants and the variables is itself a significant factor in the nature of the particular function which these magnitudes are. Conversely, however, the constants themselves are also functions; in so far as a straight line, for example, has the meaning of being the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parameter&nbsp;</em>of a parabola, then this meaning is that it is the function&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>; and in the expansion of the binomial generally, the constant which is the coefficient of the first term of the development is the sum of the roots, the coefficient of the second is the sum of the products, in pairs, and so on; here, therefore, the constants are simply functions of the roots. Where, in the integral calculus, the constant is determined from the given formula, it is to that extent treated as a function of this. Further on we shall consider these coefficients in another character than that of functions, their meaning in the concrete object being the focus of the whole interest.</p>

For this reason it should be noted, in criticism of another formalism, that the first power is only a power in relation to higher powers;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">on its own, x&nbsp;</em>is merely any indeterminate quantum. Thus there is no point in differentiating for their own sakes the equations&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax + b&nbsp;</em>(of the straight line), or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = ct</em>&nbsp;(of the plain uniform velocity); if from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax,&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ax + b,&nbsp;</em>we obtain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, or from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = ct, ds</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dt = c</em>, then&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x&nbsp;</em>is equally the determination of the tangent, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t</em>&nbsp;that of velocity simply as such. The latter is given the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;in the context of what is said to be the development of the uniformly accelerated motion; but, as already remarked, the presence in the system of such a motion, of a moment of simple, merely uniform velocity, i.e. a velocity which is not determined by the higher power of one of the moments of the motion is itself an empty assumption based solely on the routine of the method. Since the method starts from the conception of the increment which the variable is supposed to acquire, then of course a variable which is only a function of the first power can also receive an increment; when now in order to find the differential we have to subtract the difference of the second equation thus produced from the given equation, the meaninglessness of the operation becomes apparent, for, as we have remarked, the equation for the so-called increments, both before and after the operation, is the same as for the variables themselves.</p>

This consideration can yield only known results, in a form found especially in Lagrange&#39;s version; but I have made the exposition completely elementary in order to eliminate the heterogeneous determinations associated with it. The basis of treatment of an equation of this kind shows itself to be this, that the power is taken as being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself</em>a relation or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system of relations</em>. We said above that power is number which has reached the stage where it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determines its own alteration,&nbsp;</em>where its moments of unit and amount are identical &mdash; as previously shown,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely</em>&nbsp;identical first in the square,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formally</em>(which makes no difference here) in higher powers. Now power is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">number&nbsp;</em>(magnitude as the more general term may be preferred, but it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>always number), and hence a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality,&nbsp;</em>and also is represented as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum;</em>&nbsp;it can therefore be directly analysed into an arbitrary amount of numbers which have no further determination relatively to one another or to their sum, other than that together they are equal to the sum. But the power can also be split into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of differences which are determined by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of the power.&nbsp;</em>If the power is taken as a sum, then its radical number, the root, is also taken as a sum, and arbitrarily after manifold divisions, which manifoldness, however, is the indifferent, empirically quantitative element. The sum which the root is supposed to be, when reduced to its simple determinateness, i.e. to its genuine universality, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">binomial;&nbsp;</em>all further increase in the number of terms is a mere<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repetition&nbsp;</em>of the same determination and therefore meaningless.</p>

It was said that the variable into the determination of which power enters is regarded as within itself a sum, in fact a system of terms in so far as these are functions of the potentiation, and that thus the root, too, is regarded as a sum and in the simply determined form of a binomial:<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;= (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">z</em>)<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;= (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ny</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">n</em>-1)</sup><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">z&nbsp;</em>+ ... ).

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>as such of the magnitudes is, on the one hand, all that remains after abstraction is made from the plus of a sum as such, and on the other hand, all that is needed for finding the functions produced by the expansion of the power.</p>

In this complex, each of these variables is posited simply as in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to the others with the meaning, one could say, of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>implicit in it &mdash; as a function of the other variables; their character, that of being functions of one another, gives them this determination of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>which, however, for that same reason, is wholly<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate &mdash; not&nbsp;</em>an increase or an increment, or anything of that nature.

But the so-called increment is supposed to be not a quantum but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a form,&nbsp;</em>the whole value of which is that it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assists&nbsp;</em>the development; it is admitted &mdash; most categorically by Euler and Lagrange and in the previously mentioned conception of limit &mdash; that what is wanted is only the resulting power determinations of the variables, the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficients,&nbsp;</em>namely, of the increment and its powers, according to which the series is ordered and to which the different coefficients belong. On this we could perhaps remark that since an increment (which has no quantum) is assumed only for the sake of the development, it would be most appropriate to take i (the one) for that purpose, for in the development this always occurs only as a factor; the factor one, therefore, fulfils the purpose, namely, that the increment is not to involve any quantitative determinateness or alteration; on the other hand,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>which is burdened with the false idea of a quantitative difference, and other symbols like i with the mere show &mdash; pointless here &mdash; of generality, always have the appearance and pretension of a quantum and its powers; which pretension then involves the trouble that they must nevertheless be removed and left out. In order to retain the form of a series expanded on the basis of powers, the designations of the exponents as indices could equally well be attached to the one. But in any case, abstraction must be made from the series and from the determination of the coefficients according to their place in the series; the relation between all of them is the same; the second function is derived from the first in exactly the same manner as this is from the original function, and for the function counted as second, the first derived function is itself original. But the essential point of interest is not the series but simply and solely the determination of the power resulting from the expansion in its relation to the variable which for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power determination is immediate.&nbsp;</em>It should not therefore be defined as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficient</em>&nbsp;of the first term of the development, for it is first only in relation to the other terms following it in the series, and a power such as that of an increment, like the series itself, is here out of place; instead, the simple expression: derived function of a power, or as was said above: function of potentiation of a magnitude, would be preferable &mdash; the knowledge of the way in which the derivation is taken to be a development included within a power being presupposed.</p>

This operation is therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">applicable&nbsp;</em>in the case of those objects in which there is also present such a difference of power determinations. Now if we reflect on the specific nature of space, we find that it contains the three dimensions which, in order to distinguish them from the abstract differences of height, length and breadth, we can call concrete &mdash; namely, line, surface and total space; and when they are taken in their simplest forms and with reference to self-determination and consequently to analytical dimensions, we have the straight line, plane surface and surface taken as a square, and the cube. The straight line has an empirical quantum, but with the plane there enters the qualitative element, the determination of power; further modifications, e.g. the fact that this also happens in the case of plane curves, we need not consider, for we are concerned primarily with the distinction in general. With this there arises, too, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">need to pass from a higher power to a lower, and vice versa,&nbsp;</em>when, for example, linear determinations are to be derived from given equations of the plane, or vice versa. Further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>in which we have to consider the quantitative relation of the space traversed to the time elapsed, manifests itself in the different determinations of a motion which is simply uniform, or uniformly accelerated, or alternately uniformly accelerated and uniformly retarded, and thus a self-returning motion; since these different kinds of motion are expressed in accordance with the quantitative relation of their moments, of space and time, their equations contain different determinations of powers, and when it is necessary to determine one kind of motion, or a spatial magnitude to which one kind of motion is linked, from another kind of motion, the operation also involves the passage from one power-function to another, either higher or lower. These two examples may suffice for the purpose for which they are cited.</p>

But now the further point of interest within these spheres themselves is to know between what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parts&nbsp;</em>of the subject matter of the mathematical problem such a relation occurs as is posited peculiarly by the differential calculus. First, it must be observed that there are two kinds of relation. The operation of depotentiating an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equation&nbsp;</em>considered according to the derivative functions of its variables, yields a result which,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself,&nbsp;</em>is no longer truly an equation but a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation;&nbsp;</em>this relation is the subject matter of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">differential calculus proper.</em>This also gives us, secondly, the relation of the higher power form (the original equation) itself to the lower (the derivative). This second relation we must ignore for the time being; it will prove to be the special subject matter of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">integral calculus.</em></p>

It will be sufficient here to refer to Barrow, to him who was Newton&#39;s teacher. In his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lect. Opt. et Geom.,&nbsp;</em>in which he treats problems of higher geometry according to the method of indivisibles, a method which, to begin with, is distinct from the characteristic feature of the differential calculus, he also puts on record&#39; his procedure for determining tangents &mdash; &#39;because his friends urged him to do so&#39;. To form a proper idea of how this procedure is formulated simply as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external rule,&nbsp;</em>in the same style as the &#39;rule of three&#39;, or better still the so-called &#39;test by casting out nines&#39;, one must read Barrow&#39;s own exposition. He draws the tiny lines afterwards known as the increments in the characteristic triangle of a curve and then gives the instruction, in the form of a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rule, to reject as superfluous&nbsp;</em>the terms which, as a result of the expansion of the equations, appear as powers of the said increments or as products (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">etenim isti termini nihilum valebunt</em>); similarly, the terms which contain only magnitudes to be found in the original equation are to be rejected (the subsequent subtraction of the original equation from that formed with the increments); and finally, for the increments of the ordinate and abscissa, the ordinate itself and the subtangent respectively are to be substituted. The procedure, if one may say so, can hardly be set forth in a more schoolmaster-like manner; the latter substitution is the assumption of the proportionality of the increments of the ordinate and the abscissa with the ordinate and the subtangent, an assumption on which is based the determination of the tangent in the ordinary differential method; in Barrow&#39;s rule this assumption appears in all its naive nakedness. A simple way of determining the subtangent was found; the artifices of Roberval and Fermat have a similar character. The method for finding maximal and minimal values from which Fermat started rests on the same basis and the same procedure. It was a mathematical craze of those times to find so-called<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">methods,&nbsp;</em>i.e. rules of that kind and to make a secret of them &mdash; which was not only easy, but in one respect even necessary, for the same reason that it was easy &mdash; namely, because the inventors had found only an empirical, external rule, not a method, i.e. nothing derived from established principles. Leibniz accepted such so-called methods from his contemporaries and so did Newton who got them directly from his teacher; by generalising their form and applicableness they opened up new paths for the sciences, but at the same time they also felt the need to wrest free the procedure from the shape of merely external rules and to try to procure for it the necessary justification.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">If we analyse the method more closely, we find the genuine procedure to be as follows. Firstly the power forms (of the variables of course) contained in the equation are reduced to their first functions. But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">value&nbsp;</em>of the terms of the equation is thereby&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">altered;&nbsp;</em>there is now no longer an equation, but instead only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>between the first function of the one variable and the first function of the other. Instead of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">px = y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;we have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;: 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y,</em>&nbsp;or instead of 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ax -&nbsp;</em>x<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, we have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>, the relation which later came to be designated<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>. Now the equation represents a curve; but this relation, which is completely dependent on it and derived from it (above, according to a mere rule), is, on the contrary, a linear relation with which certain lines are in proportion:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;: 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a - x</em>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>are themselves relations of straight line of the curve, of the co-ordinates and parameters.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">But with all this, nothing is as yet known.&nbsp;</em>The interest centres on finding that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived relation&nbsp;</em>applies to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>lines connected with the curve, on finding the equality of two relations. And so there is, secondly, the question, which are the straight lines determined by the nature of the curve, standing in such a relation? But this is just what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was already known:&nbsp;</em>namely, that the relation so obtained is the relation of the ordinate to the subtangent. This the ancients had found in an ingenious geometrical manner; what the moderns have discovered is the empirical procedure of so preparing the equation of the curve that it yields that first relation of which it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was already known&nbsp;</em>that it is equal to a relation containing the line (here the subtangent) which is to be determined. Now on the one hand, this preparation of the equation &mdash; the differentiation &mdash; has been methodically conceived and executed; but on the other hand the imaginary increments of the co-ordinates and an imaginary characteristic triangle formed by them and by an equally imaginary increment of the tangent, have been invented in order that the proportionality of the ratio found by lowering the degree of the equation to the ratio formed by the ordinate and subtangent, may be represented, not as something only empirically accepted as an already familiar fact, but as something demonstrated. However, in the said form of rules, the already familiar fact reveals itself absolutely and unmistakably as the sole occasion and respective justification of the assumption of the characteristic triangle and the said proportionality.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">Now Lagrange rejected this pretence and took the genuinely scientific course. We have to thank his method for bringing into prominence the real point of interest for it consists in separating the two transitions necessary for the solution of the problem and treating and proving each of them separately. One part of this solution (for the more detailed statement of the process we shall confine ourselves to the example of the elementary problem of finding the subtangent), the theoretical or general part, namely, the finding of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first function&nbsp;</em>from the given equation of the is dealt with separately; the result is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">linear relation</em>, a curve, relation therefore of straight lines occurring in the system determined by the curve. The other part of the solution now is the finding of those lines in the curve which stand in this relation. Now this is effected in a direct manner i.e., without the characteristic triangle, which means that there is no assumption of infinitely small arcs, ordinates and abscissae, the last two being given the significance of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>that is, of being sides of that relation, and at the same time directly equating the infinitely small ordinate and abscissa with the ordinate and subtangent themselves. A line (and a point, too), is determined only in so far as it forms the side of a triangle and the determination of a point, too, falls only in such triangle. This, it may be mentioned in passing, is the fundamental proposition of analytical geometry from which are derived the co-ordinates of that science, just as (it is the same standpoint) in mechanics it gives rise to the parallelogram of forces, for which very reason the many efforts to find a proof of this latter are quite unnecessary. The subtangent, now, is made to be the side of a triangle whose other sides are the ordinate and the tangent connected to it. The equation of the latter, as a straight line, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p = aq&nbsp;</em>(the determination does not require the additional term, + b which is added only on account of the fondness for generality); &mdash; the determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>p/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q&nbsp;</em>falls within a, the coefficient of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q</em>&nbsp;which is the respective first function (derivative) of the equation, but may simply be considered only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q&nbsp;</em>being, as we have said, the essential determination of the straight line which is applied as tangent to the curve. But the first function (derivative) of the equation of the curve is equally the determination of a straight line; seeing then that the co-ordinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;of the first straight line and y, the co-ordinate of the curve, are assumed to be identical (so that the point at which the curve is touched by the first straight line assumed as tangent is also the starting point of the straight line determined by the first function of the curve), the problem is to show that this second straight line coincides with the first, i.e. is a tangent; or, algebraically expressed, that since&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p = Fq,&nbsp;</em>and it is assumed that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = p</em>&nbsp;and hence that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx = Fq</em>, therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">f&#39;x = F&#39;q.&nbsp;</em>Now in order to show that the straight line applied as a tangent and the straight line determined by the first function of the equation coincide, and that therefore the latter is a tangent, Descartes has recourse to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment i&nbsp;</em>of the abscissa and to the increment of the ordinate determined by the expansion of the function. Thus here, too, the objectionable increment also makes its appearance; but its introduction for the purpose indicated and its role in the expansion of the function must be carefully distinguished from the previously mentioned employment of the increment in finding the differential equation and in the characteristic triangle. Its employment here is justified and necessary because it falls within the scope of geometry, the geometrical determination of a tangent as such implying that between it and the curve with which it has a point in common, no other straight line can be drawn which also passes through the said point. For, as thus determined, the quality of tangent or not-tangent is reduced to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative difference,&nbsp;</em>that line being the tangent of which simply<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater smallness&nbsp;</em>is predicated with respect to the determination in point. This seemingly only relative smallness contains no empirical element whatever, i.e. nothing dependent on a quantum as such; in virtue of the nature of the formula it is explicitly qualitative if the difference of the moments on which the magnitude to be compared depends is a difference of powers. Since this difference becomes that of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>&nbsp;(which after all is meant to signify a number) is then to be conceived as a fraction,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;is therefore in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself and explicitly&nbsp;</em>smaller than&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>, so that the very conception of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arbitrary&nbsp;</em>magnitude in connection with i is here superfluous and in fact out of place. For the same reason the demonstration of the greater smallness has nothing to do with an infinitesimal, which thus need not be brought in here at all.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;">I must also mention the tangential method of Descartes, if only for its beauty and its fame &mdash; well-deserved but nowadays mostly forgotten; it has, moreover, a bearing on the nature of equations and this, again, calls for a further remark. Descartes expounds this independent method, in which the required linear determination is likewise found from the same derivative function, in his geometry which has proved to be so fruitful in other respects tool; in it he has taught the great basis of the nature of equations and their geometrical construction, and also of the application of analysis, thereby greatly widened in its scope, to geometry. With him the problem took the form of drawing straight lines perpendicularly to given points on a curve as a method for determining the subtangent, etc. One can understand the satisfaction he felt at his discovery, which concerned an object of general scientific interest at that time and which is so purely geometrical and therefore was greatly superior to the mere rules of his rivals, referred to above. His words are as follows: &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">J&#39;ose dire que c&#39;est ceci le probleme le plus utile et le plus general, non seulement que je sache, mais meme que j&#39;aie l&#39;amais desire de savoir en giometrie.</em>&#39; He bases his solution on the analytic equation of the right-angled triangle formed by the ordinate of the point on the curve to which the required straight line in the problem is to be drawn perpendicularly, by this same straight line (the normal), and thirdly, by that part of the axis which is cut off by the ordinate and the normal (the subnormal). Now from the known equation of a curve, the value of either the ordinate or the abscissa is substituted in the said triangle, the result being an equation of the second degree (and Descartes shows how even curves whose equations contain higher powers reduce to this); in this equation, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of the variables occurs, namely, as a square and in the first degree &mdash; a quadratic equation which at first appears as a so-called impure equation. Descartes now makes the reflection that if the assumed point on the curve is imagined to be a point of intersection of the curve and of a circle, then this circle will also cut the curve in another point and we shall then get for the unequal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>s thus produced, two equations with the same constants and of the same form, or else only one equation with unequal values of x. But the equation only becomes one for the one triangle in which the hypotenuse is perpendicular to the curve or is the normal, the case being conceived of in this way, that the two points of intersection of the curve and the circle are made to coincide and the circle is thus made to touch the curve. But in that case it is also true that the x or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>of the quadratic equation no longer have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unequal&nbsp;</em>roots. Now since in a quadratic equation with two equal roots the coefficient of the term containing the unknown in the first power is twice the single root, we obtain an equation which yields the required determinations. This procedure must be regarded as the brilliant device of a genuinely analytical mind, in comparison with which the dogmatically assumed proportionality of the subtangent and the ordinate with the postulated infinitely small, so-called increments, of the abscissa and ordinate drops into the background.</p>

The differentiation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- ax</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;= 0 yields the new equation 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x -&nbsp;</em>a = 0; or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- px - q&nbsp;</em>= 0 gives 3<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- p</em>&nbsp;= 0. But it suggests itself here to remark that it is by no means self-evident that such a derivative equation is also correct. We have already pointed out that an equation with two variables (which, just because they are variables, do not lose their character of being unknown quantities) yields only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportion;&nbsp;</em>and for the simple reason stated, namely, that when the functions of potentiation are substituted for the powers themselves, the value of both terms of the equation is altered and it is not yet known whether an equation still exists between them with their values thus altered. All that the equation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx = P</em>&nbsp;expresses is that P is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>and no other real meaning can be ascribed to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dyldx.&nbsp;</em>But even so, we still do not know of this ratio =&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">P</em>, to what other ratio it is equal; and it is only such equation or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportionality</em>&nbsp;which gives a value and meaning to it. We have already mentioned that this meaning, which was called the application, was taken from another source, empirically; similarly, in the case of the equations here under discussion which have been obtained by differentiation, it is from another source that we must know whether they have equal roots in order that we may learn whether the equation thus obtained is still correct. But this fact is not expressly brought to notice in the textbooks; it is disposed of, certainly, when an equation with one unknown, reduced to zero, is straightway equated with y, with the result, of course, that differentiation yields a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>i.e. only a ratio. The functional calculus, it is true, is supposed to deal with functions of potentiation and the differential calculus with differentials; but it by no means follows from this alone that the magnitudes from which the differentials or functions of potentiation are taken, are themselves supposed to be only functions of other magnitudes. Besides, in the theoretical part, in the instruction to derive the differentials, i.e. the functions of potentiation, there is no indication that the magnitudes which are to be subjected to such treatment are themselves supposed to be functions of other magnitudes.</p>

In the usual exposition, the omission of the so-called constants (which are connected with the other terms only by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus and minus</em>) results from the mere mechanism of the process of differentiation, in which to find the differential of a compound expression only the variables are given an increment, and the expression thereby formed is subtracted from the original expression. The meaning of the constants and of their omission, in what respect they are themselves functions and, as such, are or are not of service, are not discussed.</p>

To differentiate denotes that differences are posited, whereas the result of differentiating is, in fact, to reduce the dimensions of an equation, and to omit the constant is to remove from the equation an element in its determinateness. As we have remarked, the roots of the variables are made equal, and therefore their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference is cancelled.&nbsp;</em>In integration, on the other hand, the constant must be added in again and although as a result the equation is integrated, it is so in the sense that the previously cancelled&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of the roots is restored, that is, what was posited as equal is differentiated again. The ordinary expression helps to obscure the essential nature of the matter and to set everything in a point of view which is not only subordinate but even alien to the main interest, the point of view, namely, of the infinitely small difference, the increment and the like, and also of the mere difference as such between the given and the derived function, without any indication of their specific, i.e. qualitative, difference.</p>

This also implies a metaphysics which is itself unsound: the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>of the fall, or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>of a period of time in which the body has fallen, is itself still a period of time; if it were not, there would be assumed a state of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rest&nbsp;</em>and hence no velocity, for velocity can only be fixed in accordance with the space traversed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in a period&nbsp;</em>of time, not at its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end.&nbsp;</em>When, however, the differential calculus is applied without restriction in other departments of physics where there is no motion at all, as for example in the behaviour of light (apart from what is called its propagation in space) and in the application of quantitative determinations to colours, and the first function of a quadratic function here is also called a velocity, then this must be regarded as an even more illegitimate formalism of inventing an existence.</p>

But another significance is acquired by the analysis of motion in connection with the determination of its trajectory; if this is a curve and its equation contains higher powers, then transitions are required from rectilinear functions, as functions of potentiation, to the powers themselves; and since the former have to be obtained from the original equation of motion containing the factor of time, this factor being eliminated, the powers must at the same time be reduced to the lower functions of development from which the said linear equations can be obtained. This aspect leads to the interesting feature of the other part of the differential calculus.</p>

Its nature has been found to consist in this, that from an equation of power functions the coefficient of the term of the expansion, the so-called first function, is obtained, and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>which this first function represents is demonstrated in moments of the concrete subject matter, these moments being themselves determined by the equation so obtained between the two relations. We shall also briefly consider the principle of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">integral calculus&nbsp;</em>to see what light is thrown on its specific, concrete nature by the application of the principle. The view of the integral calculus has been simplified and more correctly determined merely by the fact that it is no longer taken to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method of summation&nbsp;</em>in which it appeared essentially connected with the form of series; the method was so named in contrast to differentiation where the increment counts as the essential element. The problem of this calculus is, in the first instance, like that of the differential calculus, theoretical or rather formal, but it is, as everyone knows, the converse of the latter. Here, the starting point is a function which is considered as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">deriv,ed,&nbsp;</em>as the coefficient of the first term arising from the expansion of an equation as yet unknown, and the problem is to find the original power function from the derivative; what would be regarded in the natural order of the expansion as the original function is here derived, and the function previously regarded as derived is here the given, or simply original, function. Now the formal part of this operation seems to have been accomplished already in the differential calculus in which the transition and the relation of the original to the derived function in general has been established. Although in doing this it is necessary in many cases to have recourse to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of series&nbsp;</em>simply in order to obtain the function which is to be the starting point and also to effect the transition from it to the original function, it is important to remember that this form as such has nothing directly to do with the peculiar principle of integration.</p>

But this now is itself the problem: namely, to find the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">meaning&nbsp;</em>in the above-mentioned sense, possessed by the original function of the given function (regarded as first) of a particular subject matter; it might seem that this doctrine, too, was in principle already finally settled in the differential calculus; but a further circumstance is involved which prevents the matter from being so simple. In the differential calculus, namely, it was found that the linear relation is obtained from the first function of the equation of a curve, so that it is also known that the integration of this relation gives the equation of the curve in the relation of abscissa and ordinate; or, if the equation for the area enclosed by the curve were given, then we should be supposed to know already from the differential calculus that the meaning of the first function of such equation would be that it represented the ordinate as a function of the abscissa, and therefore the equation of the curve.</p>

What is given is, for example, not the equation of an area enclosed by the curve, nor, say, of the figure resulting from its rotation; nor again of an arc of the curve, but only the relation of the abscissa and ordinate in the equation of the curve itself. Consequently, the transitions from those determinations to this equation itself cannot yet be dealt with in the differential calculus; the finding of these relations is reserved for the integral calculus.</p>

Similarly, from an infinitely small element of the arc and the corresponding ordinate and abscissa, the ordinary method forms a right-angled triangle in which the square of the arc element is supposed to be equal to the sum of the squares of the two other infinitely small elements, the integration of this giving the length of the arc itself as a finite quantity.</p>

The aim of the integral calculus is this: when a certain part of a mathematical object (e.g. of a curve) is assumed to be the derived function, which other part of the object is expressed by the corresponding original function? It is known that when the function of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ordinate&nbsp;</em>given by the equation of the curve is taken as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived&nbsp;</em>function, the corresponding original function gives the quantitative expression for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">area&nbsp;</em>of the curve cut off by this ordinate; and, when a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">certain tangential&nbsp;</em>determination is identified with the derived function, the corresponding original function expresses the length of the arc belonging to this tangential determination, and so on. But the method which employs the infinitesimal, and operates with it mechanically, simply makes use of the discovery that these relations &mdash; the one of an original function to its derivative and the other of the magnitudes of two parts or elements of the mathematical object &mdash; form a proportion, and spares itself the trouble of demonstrating the truth of what it simply presupposes as a fact. The singular merit here of mathematical acumen is to have found out from results already known elsewhere, that certain specific aspects of a mathematical object stand in the relationship to each other of the original to the derived function.</p>

But the derived function is not directly given, nor is it at once evident which part or element of the mathematical object is to be correlated with the derived function in order that by reducing this to the original function there may be found that other part or element, whose magnitude is required to be determined. The usual method, as we have said, begins by representing certain parts of the object as infinitely small in the form of derived functions determinable from the originally given equation of the object simply by differentiation (like the infinitely small abscissae and ordinates in connection with the rectification of a curve); the parts selected are those which can be brought into a certain relation (one established in elementary mathematics) with the subject matter of the problem (in the given example, with the arc) this, too, being represented as infinitely small, and from this relation the magnitude required to be known can be found from the known magnitude of the parts originally taken. Thus, in connection with the rectification of curves, the three infinitely small elements mentioned are connected in the equation of the right-angled triangle, while for the quadrature of curves, seeing that area is taken arithmetically to be simply the product of lines, the ordinate and the infinitely small abscissa are connected in the form of a product. The transition from such so-called elements of the area, the arc, etc., to the magnitude of the total area or the whole arc itself, passes merely for the ascent from the infinite expression to the finite expression, or to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of the infinitely many elements of which the required magnitude is supposed to consist.</p>

It will help to elucidate the nature of the matter in hand if here, too, we indicate the details of his method in one or two examples. The declared object of his method is, precisely, to provide an independent proof of the fact that between particular elements of a mathematical whole, for example, of a curve, there exists a relation of the original to the derived function. Now this proof cannot be effected in a direct manner because of the nature of the relation itself in this domain; in the mathematical object this relation connects terms which are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>distinct, namely, curves with straight lines, linear dimensions and their functions with plane or surface dimensions and their functions, so that the required determination can only be taken as the mean between a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater&nbsp;</em>and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">less.</em>Consequently, there spontaneously enters again the form of an increment with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus and minus&nbsp;</em>and the energetic&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;developpons&#39;&nbsp;</em>is here in place; but we have already pointed out that here the increments have only an arithmetical, finite meaning. From the development of the condition that the required magnitude is greater than the one easily determinable limit and smaller than the other, it is then deduced that, e.g. the function of the ordinate is the derived, first function of the function of the area.</p>

The mode of procedure is necessarily analogous to the one just indicated. The principle of Archimedes, that the arc of a curve is greater than its chord and smaller than the sum of the two tangents drawn through the end points of the arc and contained between these points and the point of intersection of the tangents, gives no direct equation, but simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">postulates&nbsp;</em>an endless alternation between terms determined as too great or too small, the successive terms always being still too great or too small but within ever narrower limits of inaccuracy; its translation into the modern analytical form, however, takes the form of finding an expression which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per se&nbsp;</em>a simple fundamental equation. Now whereas the formalism of the infinitesimal directly presents us with the equation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dz</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">+ dy</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, Lagrange&#39;s exposition, starting from the basis indicated, demonstrates that the length of the arc is the original function to a derived function whose characteristic term is itself a function coming from the relation of a derived function to the original function of the ordinate.</p>

The infinitesimal signifies, strictly, the negation of quantum as quantum, that is, of a so-called finite expression, of the completed determinateness possessed by quantum as such.

In the exposition of Lagrange just noticed, the specific affirmative aspect which is implied in Archimedes&#39; method of developing the problem is brought to notice with the result that the procedure which is burdened with an unlimited progression is given its proper limit. The greatness of the modern invention&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per se&nbsp;</em>and its capacity to solve previously intractable problems and to treat in a simple manner those previously soluble, is to be ascribed solely to the discovery of the relation of the original to the so-called derived functions and of those parts of a mathematical whole which stand in such a relation.</p>

It was possible to confine our exposition to simple problems and the methods of solving them, it would neither have been expedient as regards the determination of the Notion, which determination is here our sole concern, not would it have lain in the author&#39;s power to have reviewed the entire compass of the so-called application of the differential and integral calculus, and by reference of all the respective problems and their solutions to what we have demonstrated to be the principle of the calculus, to have carried out completely the induction that the application is based upon this principle. But sufficient evidence has been produced to show that just as each particular mode of calculation has as its subject matter a specific determinateness or relation of magnitude, such relation constituting addition, multiplication, the raising to powers and extraction of roots, and operations with logarithms and series, and so on, so too has the differential and integral calculus; the subject matter proper to this calculus might be most appropriately named the relation between a power function and the function of its expansion or potentiation, because this is what is most readily suggested by an insight into the nature of the subject matter.</p>

The differential and integral calculus has, indeed, a more particular interest in common with the form of series namely, to determine those functions of expansion which in the series are called coefficients of the terms; but whereas the calculus is concerned only with the relation of the original function to the coefficient of the first term of its expansion, the series aims at exhibiting in the form of a sum, groups of the terms arranged according to powers which have these coefficients. The infinite which is associated with infinite series, the indeterminate expression of the negative of quantum in general, has nothing in common with the affirmative determination belonging to the infinite of this calculus. Similarly, the infinitesimal in the shape of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment,&nbsp;</em>by means of which the expansion is given the form of a series, is only an external means for the expansion, and the sole meaning of its so-called infinity is to have no other meaning beyond its significance as such means; the series, which in fact is not what is wanted, produces an excess, the elimination of which causes the unnecessary trouble. The method of Lagrange, who preferred to use the form of series again, is also burdened with this difficulty; although it is through his method, in what is called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application,</em>&nbsp;that what is truly characteristic of the calculus is brought to notice, for, without forcing the forms of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx, dy&nbsp;</em>and so on,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into the objects,&nbsp;</em>it is directly demonstrated to which part of the object the determinateness of the derived function (function of expansion) belongs; and thus it is evident that the matter in hand here is not the form of series.</p>

These arithmetical investigations include the rules of differentiation, the derivation of Taylor&#39;s theorem, etc., and even the various methods of integration. But the case is quite the reverse, for it is precisely those applications which form the subject matter of the differential calculus proper, all those arithmetical developments and operations being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed by the calculus&nbsp;</em>from analysis.&#39; We have shown how, with Lagrange, it is just the separation of the so-called application from the procedure of the general part which starts from series, which serves to bring to notice the characteristic subject matter of the differential calculus. It is strange, however, that the author, who realises that it is just these applications which form the subject matter of the differential calculus proper, should get involved in the formal metaphysics (adduced in that work) of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous magnitude, becoming,&nbsp;</em>flow, etc., and should want to add even fresh ballast to the old; these determinations are formal, in that they are only general categories which do not indicate just what is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific nature&nbsp;</em>of the subject matter, this having to be learned and abstracted from the concrete theory, that is, the applications.]</p>

But in the application to spatial objects, the qualitative determinateness of the analytic relation is fully manifested as the transition from linear to planar determinations, from determinations of straight lines to those of curves, and so on. This application further involves that spatial objects, which by their nature are given in the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous</em>magnitudes, are taken to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete,&nbsp;</em>the plane therefore as a multitude of lines, the line as a multitude of points, and so on.</p>

For the problems where the employment of this procedure is chiefly indicated, it is requisite that the element forming the starting point should be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-determined</em>&nbsp;&mdash; in contrast to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indirect&nbsp;</em>method which, on the contrary, can begin only with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits&nbsp;</em>between which lies the self-determined element as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">goal&nbsp;</em>towards which the method advances. But then the result in both methods comes to the same thing if what can be found is only the law for progressively determining the required magnitude without the possibility of reaching the perfect, that is, so-called finite, determination demanded. To Kepler is ascribed the honour of first having thought of this reversal of the process and of having made the discrete the starting point. His explanation of how he understands the first proposition in Archimedes&#39; cyclometry expresses this quite simply. Archimedes&#39; first proposition, as we know, is that a circle is equal to a right-angled triangle having one of the sides enclosing the right angle equal to the diameter and the other to the circumference of the circle. Now Kepler takes the meaning of this proposition to be that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">circumference&nbsp;</em>of the circle has as many parts as it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">points,&nbsp;</em>that is, an infinite number, each of which can be regarded as the base of an isosceles triangle, and so on; he thus gives expression to the resolution of the continuous into the form of the discrete. The expression &#39;infinite&#39; which occurs here is still far removed from the definition it is supposed to have in the differential calculus. When now a determinateness a function, has been found for such discrete elements, they are supposed to be summed up, to be essentially elements of the continuous. But since a sum of points does not make a line, or a sum of lines a plane, the points are already directly taken as linear and the lines as planar. But because these linear elements are at the same time supposed not to be lines, which they would be if they were taken as quantum, they are represented as being infinitely small. What is discrete can only be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>summed up, the moments of such sum retaining the meaning of the discrete one (unit); the analytic transition from these ones is made only to their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>and is not simultaneously the geometrical transition from the point to the line or from the line to the plane and so on; therefore the element which is determined as point or line is at the same time also given the quality of being linear or planar respectively in order that the sum,, as a sum of little lines, may become a line, or as a sum of little planes may become a plane.</p>

Before one could dispense with this expedient, it would have to be possible to show that the analytic procedure itself which appears as a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">summation, in</em>&nbsp;fact already contains a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">multiplication.&nbsp;</em>But this involves a fresh assumption which forms the basis in this application of arithmetical relations to geometrical figures: the assumption, namely, that arithmetical multiplication is also for the geometrical determination a transition into a higher dimension &mdash; that the arithmetical multiplication of magnitudes spatially determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lines&nbsp;</em>also produces a plane from the linear determination; three times four linear feet gives twelve linear feet, but three linear feet times four linear feet gives twelve superficial feet and, in fact, square feet, since the unit in both factors as discrete quantities is the same. The multiplication of lines by lines at first sight appears meaningless in so far as multiplication concerns simply numbers, i.e. is an alteration of a subject matter that is perfectly homogeneous with what it passes over into, with the product, only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude&nbsp;</em>being altered. On the other hand, what was called multiplication of a line as such by a line &mdash; it has been called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus lineae in lineam, like plant in planum,&nbsp;</em>and is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus puncti in lineam</em>&nbsp;&mdash; is an alteration not merely of magnitude, but of magnitude as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>determination of spatial character, of a dimension; the transition of the line into a plane must be understood as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-externalisation</em>of the line, and similarly the self-externalisation of the point is a line, and of the plane a whole space [volume]. This is the same as the representation of the line as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>of a point, and so forth; but motion includes a determination of time and thus appears in this representation rather as merely a contingent, external alteration of state. The transition must be grasped from the standpoint of the Notion which was expressed as a self-externalisation &mdash; the qualitative alteration which arithmetically is the multiplication of unit (point, etc.) by amount (line, etc.). We may here further remark that with the self-externalisation of the plane, which would appear as a multiplication of the plane by a plane, there is seemingly a difference between the arithmetical and geometrical operations such that the self-externalisation of the plane as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus plani in planum&nbsp;</em>would give arithmetically a multiplication of a two-dimensional factor by another such, and consequently a four-dimensional product which, however, is reduced by the geometrical determination to three. Although on the one hand number, because its principle is the one, yields the fixed determination for the external, quantitative element, yet equally, the result of operating with it is formal. Taken as a numerical determination 3 x 3 when it reproduces itself is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3; but this same magnitude as a plane, when it reproduces itself, is restricted to 3 x 3 x 3, because space, represented as an expansion outwards from the point, from the merely abstract limit, has its true limit as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>determinateness beyond the line in the third dimension. The difference referred to could prove itself effective as regards free motion in which one side, the spatial side has a geometrical significance (in Kepler&#39;s law,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>) and the other, the temporal side, is an arithmetical determination.</p>

There, the qualitative element lay in the determinateness of power; here, like the infinitely small, it is only the factor as arithmetically related to the product, or as the point to the line or the line to the plane, and so on. Now the qualitative transition which has to be made from the discrete (into which continuous magnitude is imagined to be resolved), to t e continuous, is effected as a process o summation.</p>

This height is represented as being merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount</em>&nbsp;of a multitude of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete&nbsp;</em>magnitudes which must be summed up. These magnitudes are lines which lie parallel between the said limiting parallels; there are infinitely many of them for they are supposed to constitute the plane, and yet are lines which therefore, in order to possess the character of a plane, must at the same time be posited with negation. In order to escape the difficulty that a sum of lines is supposed to give a plane, the lines are directly assumed to be planes but also as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinitely narrow,&nbsp;</em>for they have their determination solely in the linear quality of the parallel limits of the trapezium. As parallel and bounded by the other pair of rectilinear sides of the trapezium, these lines can be represented as the terms of an arithmetical progression, having a simply uniform difference which does not, however, require to be determined, and whose first and last terms are these two parallel lines; as we know, the sum of such a series is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">product</em>of the parallels and half the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount or number&nbsp;</em>of terms. This last quantum is called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount or number&nbsp;</em>simply and solely with reference to the conception of infinitely many lines; it is simply the specific magnitude of something which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous</em>&nbsp;&mdash; the height. It is clear that what is called a sum is at the same time a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus lineae in lineam, a multiplication&nbsp;</em>of lines by lines, and so according to the above determination the result is something having the quality of a plane. In the simplest case of any rectangle&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">AB,&nbsp;</em>each of the two factors is a simple magnitude; but even in the further, still elementary example of the trapezium, only one of the factors is simple as half of the height. The other, on the contrary, is determined by a progression; it is also linear but its specific magnitude is more complex; and since it can be expressed only by a series, the problem of summing it is called analytical, i.e. arithmetical; but the geometrical moment in it is multiplication, the qualitative element of the transition from the dimension of line to that of plane; the one factor was taken to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete</em>&nbsp;only for the arithmetical determination of the other; by itself it is, like the other, the magnitude of a line.</p>

Those who want to avoid here the representation of an area as a sum of lines resort to the usual, quite unnecessary expedient of making the ordinates into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">trapezia&nbsp;</em>of infinitely small breadth; since the equation is only a proportion, only one of the two linear elements of the plane comes into the comparison. The other, the abscissa axis, is assumed as equal in ellipse and circle, as a factor therefore arithmetically equal to i, and consequently the proportion depends solely on the relation of the one determining moment. The two dimensions are necessary to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation&nbsp;</em>of a plane, but the quantitative determination required to be indicated in this proportion affects only the one moment; to be swayed by the representation of a plane, or to help it out by adding the idea of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>to this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one</em>&nbsp;moment, is really to fail to recognise the essential mathematical element here involved.</p>

These indivisibles are lines when he is considering a plane, and squares or plane circles when he is considering a pyramid or a cone, etc. The base line or basic plane which is assumed as determined, he calls the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">regula;&nbsp;</em>it is the constant, and with reference to a series it is its first or last term. The indivisibles are regarded as parallel with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">regula</em>and therefore as having the same determination as this with respect to the figure. Now Cavalieri&#39;s general fundamental proposition is &#39;that all figures, both plane and solid, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportionate&nbsp;</em>to all their indivisibles, these being compared with each other collectively and, if there is a common proportion in the figures, distributively&#39;.&#39; For this purpose, he compares in figures of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same</em>&nbsp;base and height, the proportions between lines drawn parallel to the base and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistant&nbsp;</em>from it; all such lines in a figure have one and the same determination and constitute its whole content. In this way, too, Cavalieri proves for example the elementary proposition that parallelograms of equal height are proportional to their bases; any two lines drawn equidistant from and parallel to the base in both figures are in the same proportion as the base lines and so therefore are the whole figures. The lines do not in fact constitute the whole content of the figure as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous, but</em>&nbsp;only the content in so far as it is to be arithmetically&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined;</em>&nbsp;it is the line which is the element of the content and through it alone must be grasped the specific nature of the figure.</p>

But in parallelograms of equal height and base, only the latter determinateness is an external limit; the height (not the parallelism as such), on which is based the second main determination of the figures, their proportion, introduces a second principle of determination additional to the external limits. Euclid&#39;s proof of the equality of parallelograms having the same height and base reduces them to triangles, to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous figures limited externally;</em>&nbsp;in Cavalieri&#39;s proof, primarily in that of the proportionality of parallelograms, the limit is simply a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative determinateness as such,&nbsp;</em>which is explicated in every pair of lines drawn at the same distance from each other in both figures. These lines, which are equal or in an equal ratio with the base, taken<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">collectively give</em>&nbsp;figures standing in the same ratio. The conception of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate</em>&nbsp;of lines is incompatible with the continuity of the figure; the essential determinateness is completely exhausted by a consideration of the lines alone. Cavalieri frequently answers the objection that the conception of indivisibles involves the comparison of lines or planes as if they were infinite in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount;&#39;&nbsp;</em>he makes the correct distinction that he does not compare their amount, which we do not know (and which is, as we have remarked, merely an empty idea assumed in support of the theory), but only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude,&nbsp;</em>i.e. the quantitative determinateness as such which is equal to the space occupied by these lines; because this space is enclosed within limits, its magnitude too is enclosed within the same limits;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the continuous figure is nothing other than the indivisibles themselves,&nbsp;</em>he says; if it were something apart from them it would not be comparable; but it would be absurd to say that bounded continuous figures were not comparable with each other.</p>

The categories he employs in this connection, namely that the continuous is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">composed or consists&nbsp;</em>of indivisibles, and the like, are of course inadequate since they demand at the same time the intuition of the continuous or, as already said, its outer existence; instead of saying that &#39;the continuous is nothing other than the indivisibles themselves&#39;, it would be more correct and also directly self-explanatory to say that the quantitative determinateness of the continuous is none other than that of the indivisibles themselves. Calvalieri does not support the erroneous conclusion that there are greater and lesser infinites which is drawn&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by the schools&nbsp;</em>from the idea that the indivisibles constitute the continuous; further on&#39; he gives expression to his quite definite awareness that his method of proof by no means forces on him the idea that the continuous is composed of indivisibles; continuous figures follow only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportion&nbsp;</em>of the indivisibles. He says he has taken the aggregate of indivisibles not as an apparent infinity for the sake of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>number of lines or planes, but in so far as they possess a specific kind of limitedness. But then, in order to remove this stumbling block, he does not spare himself the trouble of proving the principal proportions of his geometry (in the seventh book specially added for this purpose) in a way which remains free from any admixture of infinity. This method reduces the proofs to the usual form of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coincidence&nbsp;</em>of figures above mentioned, i.e. as remarked, to the conception of determinateness as an external spatial limit.</p>

In the elementary theorems about triangles, two triangles are represented side by side; of their six component parts, three are assumed equal to the corresponding three of the other triangle and it is then shown that such triangles are congruent, i.e. that the remaining three parts of each triangle are also equal to those of the other triangle &mdash; because by virtue of the equality of the first three parts, the triangles&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coincide.&nbsp;</em>If we take the matter more abstractly, then it is just because of this equality of each pair of corresponding parts in both triangles that there is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one</em>&nbsp;triangle before us; in this it is assumed that three parts are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">already determined&nbsp;</em>and from this follows the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the three remaining parts. In this way, the determinateness is exhibited as completed in the three parts; hence for the determinateness as such, the three remaining parts are a superfluity, the superfluity of sensuous existence, i.e. of the intuition of continuity. Expressed in this form, the qualitative determinateness stands out in its distinction from what is given in intuition, from the whole as continuous within itself; the form of coincidence does not bring this distinction to notice.</p>

This gives rise to uncertainty whether in these figures, besides the determinateness of one side, the base, which is an external limit, we are to take for the other determinateness, the other external limit, namely the other side of the parallelogram, or else the height. In the case of two such figures having the same base and height, one of them being rectangular and the other having very acute angles (the opposite angles therefore being very obtuse), the latter triangle can easily look greater than the former, when its long side is taken as the determinant and, as in Cavalieri&#39;s method,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the planes&nbsp;</em>are compared according to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of parallel lines intersecting them; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">longer&nbsp;</em>side can be regarded as a potentiality of more lines than is given by the vertical side of the rectangle. Such a conception, however, is no argument against Cavalieri&#39;s method; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of parallel lines imagined in the two parallelograms, for the purpose of comparison, also presupposes the equidistance of the lines from each other or from the base; from which it follows that the height, and not the other side of the parallelogram, is the other determining moment. But the case is different again when the comparison is between two parallelograms having the same height and base but not lying in the same plane and making different angles with a third plane; here, the parallel sections which arise, when the third plane is imagined as cutting through the parallelograms and moving parallel to itself are no longer equidistant from each other and the two planes are unequal. Cavalieri is very careful to draw attention to this distinction which he defines as the difference between a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitus rectus&nbsp;</em>and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitus obliquus&nbsp;</em>of the indivisibles and thus prevents a superficial misunderstanding which could arise on this point.&#39; I remember that an objection to indivisibles by Tacquet, an acute geometer who was also working at this time on new methods, concerns this very point: it is referred to in the above-mentioned work of Barrow who also uses the method of indivisibles, although with him it is tainted with the assumption (which he passed on to his pupil Newton and other contemporary mathematicians including Leibniz, too), that a curvilinear triangle, like the so-called characteristic triangle, may be equated with a rectilinear triangle if both are infinitely, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">very&nbsp;</em>small.</p>

Tacquet&#39;s objection to the method of indivisibles is that in the calculation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surface of</em>&nbsp;a right-angled cone, this atomistic method represents the triangle of the cone to be composed of straight&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lines&nbsp;</em>parallel to the base and perpendicular to the axis, which are at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">radii of the circles&nbsp;</em>of which the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surface&nbsp;</em>of the cone consists. Now if this surface is defined as a sum of the circumferences and this sum is determined from the number of their radii, i.e. from the length of the axis or the height of the cone, then, says Tacquet, such a result clashes with the truth formerly taught and demonstrated by Archimedes. Now Barrow counters this by showing that to determine the surface it is not the axis but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">side&nbsp;</em>of the triangle of the cone which must be taken as the line the revolution of which generates the surface; consequently, it is this line and not the axis which must be assumed as the specific magnitude for the aggregate of the circumferences.</p>

In infinite series, as in Archimedes&#39; cyclometry, the meaning of the infinite is nothing more than this: that the law determining the series being known, but the so-called finite &mdash; i.e. arithmetical &mdash; expression not being given, the reduction of the arc to the straight line cannot be effected; this incommensurability is their qualitative difference. The qualitative difference between the discrete and the continuous generally, equally contains a negative determination which makes them appear as incommensurable and introduces the infinite in the sense that the continuous which is to be taken as discrete, is no longer to possess, as continuous, any quantum. The continuous which is to be taken arithmetically as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">product,</em>&nbsp;is therefore posited as in its own self discrete, i.e. it is analysed into the elements which are its factors and in these lies its quantitative determinateness; just because they are these factors or elements, they are of a lower dimension, and as powers are concerned, are of a lower power than the magnitude of which they are the elements or factors. This difference appears arithmetically as a purely quantitative one, that of the root and power, or whatever degree of powers it may be; however, if the expression is to be taken only quantitatively, for example,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a : a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">d</em>.<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">=&nbsp;</em>2a :&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>= 2 :&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>, or for the law of descent of a falling body,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t : a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, then it yields the meaningless ratios of 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">:&nbsp;</em>a, 2 : a, 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">: at</em>; in supersession of their merely quantitative aspect, the sides would have to be held apart by their different qualitative significance, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = at</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, the magnitude in this way being expressed as a quality, as a function of the magnitude of another quality.</p>

It is this that occasions the difficulty, a difficulty which is resolved by an insight into its peculiarity and into the simple nature of the matter; but the introduction of the infinite which is meant to remove the difficulty only serves to aggravate it and prevent its solution.</p>

It continues itself into its beyond; this, in the first place, is simply another quantum. But they are essentially related to each other not as external quanta, but the determinateness of each consists in this relation to the other. In this their otherness they have thus returned into themselves; what each is, it is in the other; the other constitutes the determinateness of each. The flight of quantum away from and beyond itself has now therefore this meaning, that it changed not merely into an other, or into its abstract other, into its negative beyond, but that in this other it reached its determinateness, finding&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>in its beyond, which is another quantum. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>of quantum, the specific nature of its Notion, is its externality as such, and in ratio the quantum is now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as having its determinateness in its externality, in another quantum, and as being in its beyond what it is.</p>

When the quantum of one side is determined, the other, too, is determined by the exponent and it is quite immaterial how the first is determined; it no longer has any significance as a determinate quantum on its own, but can equally well be any other quantum without altering the value of the ratio, which depends solely on the exponent. The one which is taken as unit always remains unit however great it becomes, and the other, no matter how great it, too, becomes in consequence, must remain<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the same&nbsp;</em>amount of that unit.</p>

There is nothing to determine which side of the ratio must be taken as unit or which as amount; if the quantum B is measured in terms of quantum A as unit, then the quotient C is the amount of such units; but if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">A&nbsp;</em>is itself taken as amount, the quotient C is the unit which to the amount A is required for the quantum B. This quotient therefore is, as exponent, not posited as what it ought to be-the determinant of the ratio, or the ratio&#39;s qualitative unity. It is only posited as this in so far as it has the value of being the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity of both moments,&nbsp;</em>of unit and amount. True, these sides are present as quanta as they should be in the explicated quantum, in the ratio; but at the same time they have only the value proper to them as sides of the ratio, namely to be<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomplete&nbsp;</em>quanta and to count only as one of those qualitative moments. They must therefore be posited with this their negation and thus there arises a more developed form of the ratio, one which corresponds more to its character, a ratio in which the exponent has the significance of the product of the sides.

As we have already seen, the exponent as immediate could equally well be taken either as unit or as amount; it was then also only a simple quantum and therefore, by choice, an amount; one side was the unit, to be taken as a numerical one, of which the other side is a fixed amount and, at the same time, the exponent; the quality of this latter, therefore, was simply that this quantum is taken as fixed, or rather that this fixed quantum has the meaning only of quantum.</p>

In the direct ratio this unit is only the common element of both sides; as such, it continues itself into the other side, into the amount; and the amount itself taken by itself, or the exponent, is indifferent to the unit.</p>

Consequently, although the exponent is also only an immediate quantum arbitrarily assumed as fixed, it is not preserved as such in the side of the ratio, but this side, and with it the direct ratio of the sides, is alterable. In the ratio, then, as now before us, the exponent as the determining quantum is posited as negative towards itself as a quantum of the ratio, and hence as qualitative, as a limit-with the result that the qualitative moment is manifested independently and in distinct contrast to the quantitative moment. In the direct ratio, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration&nbsp;</em>of the two sides is only the one alteration of the quantum which is taken as unit, the common element of both sides; by as many times as the one side is increased or diminished, so also is the other: the ratio itself is not affected by this alteration which is external to it. In the indirect ratio on the other hand, although the alteration, in keeping with the indifferent quantitative moment is also arbitrary, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">confined within the ratio,&nbsp;</em>and this arbitrary quantitative fluctuation, too, is limited by the negative determinateness of the exponent as by a limit.</p>

The indirect or inverse ratio is quantum posited as a qualitative quantum, i.e., displaying itself as self-determining, as a limit of itself within itself. As such, the quantum is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first,&nbsp;</em>an immediate magnitude as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>determinateness, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>as a quantum simply affirmatively present. But secondly, this immediate<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>is also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit;&nbsp;</em>for that purpose the quantum is differentiated into two quanta which in the first instance are mutually related as others; but the quantum as their qualitative and, moreover, complete determinateness is the unity of unit and amount, a product of which the two quanta are the factors. Thus on the one hand the exponent of their ratio is in them identical with itself and is their affirmative moment which constitutes them quanta; on the other hand the exponent, as the negation posited in them, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>in them, so that although each is in the first place simply an immediate, limited quantum, it is at the same time limited in such a manner that it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>] identical with its other. Thirdly, the exponent as the simple determinateness is the negative unity of this differentiation of itself into two quanta and is the limit of their reciprocal limiting.</p>

But it can take from the other only as much as will make its own self equal to this in-itself; it has its maximum in the exponent which in accordance with the stated second determination is the limit of their reciprocal limiting. And since each is a moment of the ratio only in so far as it limits the other and is simultaneously limited by it, it loses this its determination in making itself equal to its in-itself; for in so doing not only does the other magnitude become zero, but it vanishes itself, since what it is supposed to be is not a mere quantum as such, but only quantum as such moment of a ratio. Thus each side is the contradiction between its determination as the in-itself, i.e. as unity of the whole, which is the exponent, and its determination as moment of the ratio; this contradiction is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity&nbsp;</em>again in a fresh, peculiar form.</p>

This consisted in an immediate quantum being also related to another quantum in such a way that its increase is proportional to the decrease of the other, that it is what it is through a negative relationship with the other; also, a third magnitude is the common limit of this their fluctuating increase. This fluctuation here is their distinctive character - in contrast to the qualitative moment as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fixed&nbsp;</em>limit; they have the character of variable magnitudes, for which the said fixed limit is an infinite beyond.</p>

The general result can be indicated by saying that the whole, as exponent, is the limit of the reciprocal limiting of both terms and is therefore posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation of the negation,&nbsp;</em>hence as infinity, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative&nbsp;</em>relation to itself. More specifically the exponent, simply as product, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>the unity of unit and amount, but as each term is only one of these two moments, the exponent also includes them within itself and in them is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly</em>&nbsp;related to itself. But in the inverse ratio, the difference has developed into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of quantitative being, and the qualitative moment is not merely the fixity of the exponent, or merely the immediate inclusion in it of the two moments of unit and amount, but is the identification of the exponent with itself in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-external otherness.&nbsp;</em>It is this determination which stands out as result in these moments as explicated. The exponent, namely, is found to be the in-itself which is realised in the simple alterableness of its moments as quanta; the indifference of their magnitudes in their alteration is displayed as an infinite progress, the basis of which is that in their indifference their determinateness is to have their value in the value of the other. Hence [a], in accordance with the affirmative aspect of the quantum, each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly the</em>&nbsp;whole of the exponent. Similarly [b], the quanta have for their negative moment, for their reciprocal limiting, the magnitude of the exponent; their limit is that of the exponent. The fact that they no longer have any other immanent limit, a fixed immediacy, finds expression in the infinite progress of their determinate being and of their limitation, in the negation of every particular value. This negation is, accordingly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>of the self-externality of the exponent which is displayed in the moments of the ratio; and the exponent, which is itself a simple quantum and is also differentiated into quanta, is, therefore, posited as preserving itself and uniting with itself in the negation of the indifferent existence of the quanta, thus being the determinant of its self-external otherness.</p>

This is the case in the ratio of powers where the unit, which in its own self is amount, is also amount relatively to itself as unit. The otherness, the amount of units, is the unit itself. The power is a plurality of units each of which is this same plurality. The quantum as an indifferent determinateness undergoes alteration; but in so far as this alteration is a raising to a power, this its otherness is limited purely by itself. Thus in the power, quantum is posited as returned into itself; it is at once its own self and also its otherness.</p>

As a direct ratio it is at first only the simple or unmediated form of such posited difference, so that its self-relation which it has as exponent, in contrast to its differences, counts only as the fixity of an amount of the unit. In the inverse ratio, the quantum is negatively determined as relating itself to itself-to itself as a negation of itself in which, however, it has its value; as an affirmative relation to itself it is an exponent which, as quantum, is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle&nbsp;</em>the determinant of its moments. But in the ratio of powers, quantum is present in the deference as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own difference from itself. The externality&nbsp;</em>of the determinateness is the quality of quantum and this externality is now posited in conformity with the Notion of quantum, as the latter&#39;s own self-determining, as its relation to its own self, as its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality.</em></p>

But quantity is not only a quality; it is the truth of quality itself, the latter having exhibited its own transition into quantity. Quantity, on the other hand, is in its truth the externality which is no longer indifferent but has returned into itself. It is thus quality itself in such a manner. that apart from this determination there would no longer be any quality as such. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing&nbsp;</em>of the totality requires the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">double&nbsp;</em>transition, not only of the one determinateness into its other, but equally the transition of this other, its return, into the first. The first transition yields the identity of both, but at first only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>or in principle; quality is contained in quantity, but this is still a one-sided determinateness. That the converse is equally true, namely, that quantity is contained in quality and is equally only a sublated determinateness, this results from the second transition-the return into the first determinateness. This observation on the necessity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">double&nbsp;</em>transition is of great importance throughout the whole compass of scientific method.</p>

It was shown that the chief obstacle to a grasp of the Notion of this infinite is the stopping short at its merely negative determination as the negation of quantum, instead of advancing to the simple affirmative determination which is the qualitative moment. The only further remark to be made here concerns the intrusion of quantitative forms into the pure qualitative forms of thought in philosophy. It is the relationship of powers in particular which has been applied recently to the determinations of the Notion. The Notion in its immediacy was called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first power or potence;&nbsp;</em>in its otherness or difference, in the determinate being of its moments, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second power;&nbsp;</em>and in its return into itself or as a totality, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third power.&nbsp;</em>It is at once evident that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power&nbsp;</em>as used thus is a category which essentially belongs to quantum &mdash; these powers do not bear the meaning of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">potentia,</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dynamis</em>&nbsp;of Aristotle. Thus, the relationship of powers expresses determinateness in the form or difference which has reached its truth, but difference as it is in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantum, not as it is in the Notion as such. In quantum, the negativity which belongs to the nature of the Notion is still far from being posited in the determination proper to the Notion; differences which are proper to quantum are superficial determinations for the Notion itself and are still far from being determined as they are in the Notion. It was in the infancy of philosophic thinking that numbers were used, as by Pythagoras, to designate universal, essential distinctions - and first and second power, and so on are in this respect not a whit better than numbers. This was a preliminary stage to comprehension in the element of pure thought; it was not until after Pythagoras that thought determinations themselves were discovered, i.e., became on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their own account</em>&nbsp;objects for consciousness. But to retrogress from such determinations to those of number is the action of a thinking which feels its own incapacity, a thinking which, in Opposition to current philosophical culture which is accustomed to thought determinations, now also makes itself ridiculous by pretending that this impotence is something new, superior, and an advance.</p>

The use of those forms is, therefore, nothing more than a convenient means of evading the task of grasping the determinations of the Notion, of specifying and of justifying them.</p>

The categories which Kant groups under modality &mdash; namely, possibility, actuality and necessity will occur later in their proper place; Kant did not apply the infinitely important form of triplicity &mdash; with him it manifested itself at first only as a formal spark of light &mdash; to the genera of his categories (quantity, quality, etc.), but only to their species which, too, alone he called categories. Consequently he was unable to hit on the third to quality and quantity.</p>

The first is being, the one, substance, the infinite, essence; in contrast to this abstraction the second, namely, all determinateness in general, what is only finite, accidental, perishable, non-essential, etc. can equally abstractly be grouped together; and this is what usually happens as the next step in quite formal thinking. But the connection of this second with the first is so evident that one cannot avoid grasping it as also in a unity with the latter; thus with Spinoza, the attribute is the whole substance, but is apprehended by the intellect which is itself a limitation or mode; but in this way the mode, the non-substantial generally, which can only be grasped through an other, constitutes the other extreme to substance, the third generally. Indian pantheism, too, in its monstrous fantasies has in an abstract way received this development which runs like a moderating thread through its extravagances; a point of some interest in the development is that Brahma, the one of abstract thought, progresses through the shape of Vishnu, particularly in the form of Krishna, to a third form, that of Siva. The determination of this third is the mode, alteration, coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be-the field of externality in general. This Indian trinity has misled to a comparison with the Christian and it is true that in them a common element of the nature of the Notion can be recognised; but it is essential to gain a more precise consciousness of the difference between them; for not only is this difference infinite, but it is the true, the genuine infinite which constitutes it. This third principle is, according to its determination, the dispersal of the unity of substance into its opposite,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not the return of the unity to itself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; not spirit but rather the non-spiritual. In the true trinity there is not only unity but union, the conclusion of the syllogism is a unity possessing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content and actuality,&nbsp;</em>a unity which in its wholly concrete determination is spirit. This principle of the mode and of alteration does not, it is true, altogether exclude the unity; in Spinozism, for example, it is precisely the mode as such which is untrue; substance alone is true and to it everything must be brought back. But this is only to submerge all content in the void, in a merely formal unity lacking all content. Thus Siva, too, is again the great whole, not distinct from Brahma, but Brahma himself. In other words, the difference and the determinateness only vanish again but are not preserved, are not sublated, and the unity does not become a concrete unity, neither is the disunity reconciled. The supreme goal for man placed in the sphere of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be, of modality generally, is submergence in unconsciousness, unity with Brahma, annihilation; the Buddhist Nirvana, Nibbana etc., is the same.</p>

Spinoza&#39;s mode, like the Indian principle of change, is the measureless. The Greek awareness, itself still indeterminate, that everything has a measure &mdash; even Parmenides, after abstract being, introduced necessity as the ancient limit by which all things are bounded &mdash; is the beginning of a much higher conception than that contained in substance and in the difference of the mode from substance.</p>

Measure, it is true, is an external kind and manner of determinateness, a more or less, but at the same time it is equally reflected into itself, a determinateness which is not indifferent and external but intrinsic; it is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the concrete truth of being.&nbsp;</em>That is why mankind has revered measure as something inviolable and sacred.</p>

In measure, the qualitative moment is quantitative; the determinateness or difference is indifferent and so is no difference, is sublated. This nature of quantity as a return-into-self in which it is qualitative constitutes that being-in-and-for-itself which is essence. But measure is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>or in its Notion essence; this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of measure is not yet posited. Measure, still as such, is itself the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiende</em>] unity of quality and quantity; its moments are determinately present as a quality, and quanta thereof; these moments are at first inseparable only in principle [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>], but do not yet have the significance of this reflected determination. The development of measure contains the differentiation of these moments, but at the same time their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation,&nbsp;</em>so that the identity which they are in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;</em>becomes their relation to each other, i.e. is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>The significance of this development is the realisation of measure in which it posits itself as in relation with itself, and hence as a moment. Through this mediation it is determined as sublated; its immediacy and that of its moments vanishes; they are reflected. Measure, having thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realised&nbsp;</em>its own Notion, has passed into essence.</p>

Starting from immediate, external measure it should, on the one hand, go on to develop the abstract determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>aspects of natural objects (a mathematics of nature), and on the other hand, to indicate the connection between this determination of measure and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualities&nbsp;</em>of natural objects, at least in general; for the specific proof, derived from the Notion of the concrete object, of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>between its qualitative and quantitative aspects, belongs to the special science of the concrete. Examples of this kind concerning the law of falling bodies and free, celestial motion will be found in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Encyclopedia. of the Phil. Sciences,&nbsp;</em>3rd ed., Sections 267 and 270, Remark. In this connection the general observation may be made that the different forms in which measure is realised belong also to different spheres of natural reality. The complete, abstract indifference of developed measure, i.e. the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">laws&nbsp;</em>of measure, can only be manifested in the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mechanics&nbsp;</em>in which the concrete bodily factor is itself only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;matter; the qualitative differences of such matter are essentially quantitatively determined; space and time are the purest forms of externality, and the multitude of matters, masses, intensity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">weight,&nbsp;</em>are similarly external determinations which have their characteristic determinateness in the quantitative element. On the other hand, such quantitative determinateness of abstract matter is deranged simply by the plurality of conflicting qualities in the inorganic sphere and still more even in the organic world. But here there is involved not merely a conflict of qualities, for measure here is subordinated to higher relationships and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immanent development&nbsp;</em>of measure tends to be reduced to the simple form of immediate measure. The limbs of the animal organism have a measure which, as a simple quantum, stands in a ratio to the other quanta of the other limbs; the proportions of the human body are the fixed ratio of such quanta. Natural science is still far from possessing an insight into the connection between such quantities and the organic functions on which they wholly depend. But the readiest example of the reduction of an immanent measure to a merely externally determined magnitude&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is motion.&nbsp;</em>In the celestial bodies it is free motion, a motion which is determined solely by the Notion and whose quantitative elements therefore equally depend solely on the Notion (see above); but such free motion is reduced by the living creature to arbitrary or mechanically regular, i.e. a wholly abstract, formal motion.</p>

How insipid and completely empty the so-called laws turn out to be which have been laid down about the relation of strength and weakness of sensations, general ideas, and so on, comes home to one on reading the psychologies which occupy themselves with such laws.</p>

At first, as an immediate measure it is an immediate quantum, hence just some specific quantum or other; equally immediate is the quality belonging to it, some specific quality or other. The quantum as this no longer indifferent limit but as a self-related externality, is thus itself quality, and although distinguished from it does not transcend it, neither does the quality transcend the quantum. It is thus the determinateness which has returned into simple identity with itself, one with the specific determinate being, just as this latter is one with its quantum.</p>

Everything that exists has a magnitude and this magnitude belongs to the nature of the something itself ; it constitutes its specific nature and its being-within-self. Something is not indifferent to this magnitude, so that if this were altered it would continue to be what it is; on the contrary, an alteration of the magnitude would alter the quality of the something. Quantum, as measure, has ceased to be a limit which is no limit; it is now the determination of the thing, which is destroyed if it is increased or diminished beyond this quantum.</p>

Such a unit can, it is true, also be in fact an intrinsically determinate unit, like a foot and suchlike original measures; but in so far as it is also used as a standard for other things it is in regard to them only an external measure, not their original measure. Thus the diameter of the earth or the length of a pendulum may be taken, each on its own account, as a specific quantum; but the selection of a particular fraction of the earth&#39;s diameter or of the length of the pendulum, as well as the degree of latitude under which the latter is to be taken for use as a standard, is a matter of choice. But for other things such a standard is still more something external. These have further specified the general specific quantum in a particular way and have thereby become particular things. It is therefore foolish to speak of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">natural&nbsp;</em>standard of things. Moreover, a universal standard ought only to serve for<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>comparison; in this most superficial sense in which it is taken as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal measure&nbsp;</em>it is a matter of complete indifference what is used for this purpose. It ought not to be a fundamental measure in the sense that it forms a scale on which the natural measures of particular things could be represented and from which, by means of a rule, they could be grasped as specifications of a universal measure, i.e. of the measure of their universal body. Without this meaning, however, an absolute measure is interesting and significant only as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">common element,&nbsp;</em>and as such is a universal not in itself but only by agreement.</p>

As a quantum it is an indifferent magnitude open to external determination and capable of increase and decrease. But as a measure it is also distinguished from itself as a quantum, as such an indifferent determination, and is a limitation of that indifferent fluctuation about a limit.</p>

On the one hand this destruction appears as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unexpected,&nbsp;</em>in so far as the quantum can be changed without altering the measure and the quality of the thing; but on the other hand, it is made into something quite easy to understand through the idea of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gradualness</em>.</p>

The question was asked: does the pulling out of a single hair from the head or from a horse&#39;s tail produce baldness, or does a heap cease to be a heap if a grain is removed? An answer in the negative can be given without hesitation since such a removal constitutes only a quantitative difference, a difference moreover which is itself quite insignificant; thus a hair, a grain, is removed and this is repeated, only one of them being removed each time in accordance with the answer given. At last the qualitative change is revealed; the head or the tail is bald, the heap has disappeared. In giving the said answer, what was forgotten was not only the repetition, but the fact that the individually insignificant quantities (like the individually insignificant disbursements from a fortune)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">add up&nbsp;</em>and the total constitutes the qualitative whole, so that finally this whole has vanished; the head is bald, the purse is empty.</p>

But as such, it would be nothing but an external quantum; the exponent here must be understood as nothing else but the qualitative moment itself which specifies the quantum as such. As we have already seen, the strictly immanent qualitative form of the quantum is solely its determination as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power.&nbsp;</em>It must be such a determination which constitutes the ratio and which here, as the intrinsic determination of the quantum, confronts the quantum as externally constituted. The principle of the quantum is the numerical one which constitutes its intrinsic determinedness, and the mode of relation of the numerical one is external; and the alteration which is specified only by the nature of the immediate quantum as such, consists by itself in the addition of such a numerical one and then another and so on. If in this way the alteration of the external quantum is an arithmetical progression, the specifying reaction of the qualitative nature of measure produces another series which is related to the first, increases and decreases with it, but not in a ratio determined by a numerical exponent but in a number of incommensurable ratios, according to a determination of powers.</p>

As a quantum it is an external temperature, and that too, of a body as a general medium, and it is assumed that the alteration of the temperature proceeds on the scale of an arithmetical progression, increasing or decreasing uniformly. On the other hand, the particular bodies in the medium differ in the way they absorb the temperature, for through their immanent measure they determine it as received from outside themselves and the change of temperature in any one of them does not correspond in a direct ratio with that of the medium or of the other bodies among themselves. Different bodies compared at one and the same temperature give the numerical ratios of their specific heats, of their thermal capacities. But the thermal capacities of bodies vary in different temperatures and associated with this is a change in the specific shape. Thus a particular specification is manifested in the increase or decrease of temperature. The ratio of the temperature, taken as external, to the temperature of a specific body which is at the same time dependent on the former temperature, has no fixed exponent; the increase or decrease of this heat does not proceed uniformly with the increase or decrease of the external heat. Here a temperature is assumed which is purely external and whose changes are merely external or purely quantitative. But the temperature is itself the temperature of the air or some other specific temperature. The ratio, therefore, if looked at more closely, would strictly speaking have to be taken not as the ratio of a merely quantitative quantum to a qualitative one, but as the ratio of two specific quanta. In fact, the determining of the specifying ratio has now advanced to the stage where the moments of measure not only consist of a quantitative side and a side qualifying the quantum, both being sides of one and the same quality, but are related to each other as two qualities which are in themselves measures.</p>

This qualitative side thus has a quantum for its presupposition and its starting point. But this quantum is also qualitatively distinguished from the quality itself; this difference between them is now to be posited in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy</em>&nbsp;of being as such, in which determination measure still is. The two sides are thus qualitatively related and each is on its own account a qualitative determinate being; and the one quantum which at first was only a formal quantum indeterminate in itself, is the quantum of a something and of its quality, and also &mdash; now that the connection between them is determined as a measure &mdash; the specific magnitude of these qualities. These qualities are related to each other according to their determination as measures which determination is their exponent. But they are already implicitly related to each other in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-self&nbsp;</em>of measure; the quantum in its dual character is both external and specific so that each of the distinct quantities possesses this twofold determination and is at the same time inseparably linked with the other; it is in this way alone that the qualities are determined. They are therefore not only simply determinate beings existing for each other but they are posited as inseparable and the specific magnitude connected with them is a qualitative unity &mdash; a single determination of measure in which, in accordance with their Notion, they are implicitly bound up with each other. Measure is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immanent</em>&nbsp;quantitative relationship of two qualities to each other.</p>

In immediate measure this alteration is not yet posited; it is only an arbitrary, single quantum to which a quality is bound. In the specifying of measure (the preceding determination), which is an alteration of the merely external quantum by the qualitative element, there is posited the distinction between the two specific magnitudes and hence generally the plurality of measures in a common, external quantum. It is in this distinguishedness of the quantum from itself that it first shows itself to be a real measure; for it now appears as a determinate being which is both one and the same (e.g. the constant temperature of the medium), and also quantitatively varied (in the different temperatures of the bodies present in the medium). This distinguishedness of the quantum in the different qualities (the different bodies) gives a further form of measure, that in which the two sides are mutually related as qualitatively determinate quanta.

Taken at first simply as specific magnitudes in their ratio as measures, one of them is an amount which increases and decreases in an external arithmetical progression, the other is an amount which is specifically determined by the first, which for it is unit. Now if each were only just a particular quality, that element of difference would be lacking which, with regard to their character as quantities, would indicate which of them was to be taken as merely externally quantitative and which as varying according to the specifying of its magnitude. If, for example, they are related as root and square, it is immaterial which is regarded as increasing or decreasing merely externally in arithmetical progression, and which, on the other hand, as specifically determining the other quantum.</p>

But the immediacy which is thus posited is the negation of the qualitative determination of measure; this has already been demonstrated in respect of the sides of this determination of measure which for that reason appeared as independent qualities. Such negation and the return to the immediate determination of quantity lies in the qualitatively determined relation, for the relation of distinct terms as such implies their correlation as one determinateness which latter, in distinction from the determination of the relation, is here in the sphere of quantity a quantum. As a negation of the distinct qualitatively determined sides, this exponent is a being-for-self or absolute determinedness; but it is such being-for-self only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>]; as a determinate being it is a simple immediate quantum which is the quotient or exponent of a direct ratio between the sides of the measure, but in general is the unit appearing as empirical, in the quantitative side of measure. In the motion of failing bodies the spaces traversed are proportional to the squares of the elapsed times,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = at</em>2. This is the specifically determined relation of space and time, a ratio of powers. The other, the direct ratio, would concern space and time as mutually indifferent qualities; it is supposed to be the ratio of the space traversed to the first unit of time. The same coefficient a remains in all the following units of time &mdash; the unit being an ordinary quantum, while the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount&nbsp;</em>is determined by the specifying measure. This unit at the same time counts as the exponent of that direct ratio which belongs to the imaginary, spurious velocity i.e. the merely formal velocity which is not specifically determined by the Notion. Such a velocity does not exist here, any more than the one previously mentioned which is supposed to accrue to the falling body at the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>of a unit of time. That velocity was ascribed to the first unit of time in the motion of a falling body; but this so-called unit of time is itself only an assumed unit and has as such atomic point no real being.</p>

The said empirical quantum is attributed to the force of gravity, on the supposition that this force itself has no connection with the actual specification, with the ratio of powers characteristic of a determination of measure. The<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>moment, that in the motion of a falling body the amount of some fifteen spatial units, taken as feet, is traversed in a unit &mdash; the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>unit &mdash; of time, a second, is an immediate measure, like the measurements of the limbs of the human body, the distances and diameters of the planets and so forth. The determination of such a measure falls elsewhere than in the qualitative measure determination itself, here in the law of descent of a falling body; however, the concrete sciences have so far failed to throw any light on the basis of determination of such numbers, which are only immediate and consequently are the empirical embodiment of a measure. Here we are concerned only with the determinateness specified by the Notion, namely, that the said empirical coefficient constitutes the moment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-self</em>&nbsp;in the measure-determination, and that too only in so far as this moment is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unexplicated</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>], and hence an immediacy. The second moment is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">developed</em>&nbsp;side of this being-for-self, the specific measure determinateness of the sides. In the motion of falling, a motion which is still half-conditioned and half-free, gravity, according to this second moment, is to be regarded as a force of nature, so that the relationship expressed by the law of descent of a falling body is determined by the nature of space and time, and consequently the said specification, namely, the ratio of powers, falls within gravity; the above-mentioned simple direct ratio expresses only a mechanical relationship between space and time in the [merely] formal velocity which is externally produced and determined.</p>

This direct ratio is, so to speak, anticipated and assumed as given in the example used of a measure, namely the law of descent of a falling body; but still, as we remarked, it does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exist&nbsp;</em>in this motion. The fact, however, that the two sides of measure are themselves measures, the one immediate and external, and the other immanently specified, both being contained within the unity of measure itself, means that measure is now further determined,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is realised.&nbsp;</em>As this unity, measure contains the relation in which the magnitudes are determined and posited as differently specified by the nature of the qualities; its determinateness is accordingly wholly immanent and self-subsistent, and has at the same time collapsed into the being-for-self of an immediate quantum, the exponent of a direct ratio. The self-determination of the relation is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negated,&nbsp;</em>for in this its other it has its final, explicit determinateness; and conversely, the immediate measure which is supposed to be in its own self qualitative, possesses in truth such qualitative determinateness only in the other side of the relation. This negative unity is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real being-for-self</em>, the category of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>as a unity of qualities which are related as measures &mdash; a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>something. The two sides which have presented themselves as distinct relations also immediately possess a twofold existence; or, to put it more explicitly, a self-subsistent whole of this kind, just because it is a real being-for-self, is at the same time a repulsion into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct self-subsistent somethings</em>&nbsp;whose qualitative nature and subsistence (materiality) lies in their measure determinateness.</p>

Space and time are also moments of such measures but their relationship no longer depends simply on their own nature because they are now subordinated to further determinations. Among the determining moments in sound, for example, there is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">time&nbsp;</em>in which a number of vibrations occur, and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial</em>&nbsp;element of length and thickness of the vibrating body; but the magnitudes of those ideal moments are determined externally. Space and time are no longer in a relation of powers but in the ordinary direct relation, harmony being reduced to a quite external simplicity of numbers whose relations can be grasped with the utmost ease and hence afford a satisfaction falling entirely within the element of sensation since there is an absence for spirit of figurate conception, fantasy, abstract thought, and the like. In that the sides which now constitute the measure relation are themselves measures, but at the same time real somethings, their measures are, in the first place, immediate measures and as regards their relations, direct relations. It is the inter-relationship of such relations that is now to be considered in its progressive determination.</p>

This specification as an external relating to a plurality of others in general, produces other relations and hence other measures; and the specific self-subsistence does not continue as a single direct relation but passes over into a specific determinateness which is a series of measures. Secondly, the direct relations thus produced are in themselves determinate and exclusive measures (elective affinities); but because the difference between them is also only quantitative, the progressive determination of the relations presents itself as in part a merely externally quantitative development which, however, is also interrupted by qualitative relationships and forms a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nodal line&nbsp;</em>of specific self-subsistent measure relations. Thirdly, however, in this development measure gives place to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measureless&nbsp;</em>as such, and more specifically to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity&nbsp;</em>of measure. In this, the self-exclusive and self-subsistent measures are one with each other, and the self-subsistent measure enters into a negative relation with itself.</p>

One of them is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-within-self or inwardness&nbsp;</em>of the something by virtue of which it is a real being-for-self, a material thing (such as, taken intensively, weight, or in its extensive aspect, the multiplicity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">material&nbsp;</em>parts); the other quality is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of this inwardness (the abstract, ideal element of space). These qualities are quantitatively determined and their correlation constitutes the qualitative nature of the material something &mdash; e.g. the ratio of weight to volume: specific gravity. The volume, the ideal aspect, is to be taken as unit, but the intensive aspect, which manifests quantitatively and in comparison with the former as an extensive magnitude, as a plurality of independent ones, is to be taken as amount. The purely qualitative relation of the two specific magnitudes, that is, as a ratio of powers, has vanished, because with the self-subsistence of the material thing immediacy has returned and in this the specific magnitude is an ordinary quantum whose relation to the other side is likewise determined as the ordinary exponent of a direct ratio.</p>

The exponent constitutes the specific intrinsic determinedness, the inner characteristic measure of something; but because this its measure rests on a quantum, it too is only an external, indifferent determinateness, with the consequence that the something, in spite of its inner determination as a measure, is alterable. The other to which it can, as alterable, enter into relation is not a material plurality, quantum in general &mdash; this it can withstand through its specific intrinsic determinedness -but it is a quantum which is at the same time also an exponent of such a specific ratio. Two things with different internal measures stand in relation and enter into combination &mdash; such as two metals of different specific gravities (the combination in question would not be, for example, of a metal and water); but what other kind of homogeneity is required to make possible such a combination will not be considered here. Now on the one hand, each of the two measures, just because it is a measure, preserves itself in the alteration which it ought to suffer through the externality of the quantum, but on the other hand this self-preservation is itself a negative relation towards this quantum, a specification of it; and since the quantum is the exponent of the measure relation, the self-preservation is an alteration of the measure itself and moreover a reciprocal specification.</p>

But this is true only of the weight of the mixture, which is equal to the sum of the weights before the combination; addition applies to that quality which, as a real being-for-self, has acquired a fixed determinate being with a permanent immediate quantum &mdash; the weight of the material thing, or, what counts as the same from the quantitative point of view, the number or amount of material parts. The exponents however are subject to alteration since they are the expression of the qualitative aspect of the compound, of its being-for-self in the form of measure relations; and since the quantum as such suffers contingent external alteration by an increase which is summed, the being-for-self at the same time displays itself as negating this externality. Because this immanent determining of the quantitative element cannot, as we have seen, be manifested in the weight, it displays itself in the other quality which is the ideal side of the relation. From the point of view of sense perception it may appear remarkable that the mixing of two specifically different material substances should be followed by an alteration &mdash; usually a diminution-in the sum of the two volumes, for it is space itself which constitutes the subsistence of matter in its external separated existence. But this subsistence in face of the negativity immanent in the being-for-self lacks intrinsic being, it is subject to alteration. In this manner space is posited as what it truly is, an ideal being.</p>

But a thing which is an immanent measure relation is self-subsistent; it is therefore also capable of combining with another such thing. But in being reduced to an element of this unity, it preserves itself through the persistence of its indifferent, quantitative character and at the same time functions as a specifying moment of a new measure relation. Its quality is masked in the quantitative element and is thus also indifferent towards the other measure, continuing itself in it and in the newly formed measure. The exponent of the new measure is itself only some quantum or other, an external determinateness, and its indifference finds expression in the fact that the specifically determined thing effects, in association with other such measures, precisely similar neutralizations of the reciprocal measure relations; it is in only one measure relation formed by itself and another specifically determined thing that its specific peculiarity is not expressed.</p>

But the exponents of these ratios differ and the qualitative exponent of the self-subsistent measure is thus represented as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">series</em>of these&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different amounts&nbsp;</em>of which it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit,&nbsp;</em>i.e. as a series whose members are in a specific relationship to others. The qualitative exponent, as one immediate quantum, expresses only one relation. The distinctive character of the self-subsistent measure finds its true expression in the characteristic series of exponents which it, taken as unit, forms with other such self-subsistent measures; for one of these measures when brought into relation with the rest of them and taken as unit forms another series. Now it is the interrelationship of the members of such a series that constitutes the qualitative aspect of the self-subsistent measure.</p>

This specific unit is to be sought, as has been indicated, only in that feature which embodies the specific determinate being of the measures to be compared, i.e. in the ratio which the exponents of the ratios of the members of the series have to each other. This ratio of the exponents themselves is, however, such independent and actually specific unit only in so far as the members of the series together have it as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant</em>&nbsp;ratio to both measures; in that way it can be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their common unit.&nbsp;</em>It is this alone, therefore, which makes it possible to compare the two self-subsistent measures which were assumed to be not reciprocally neutralising measures, but indifferent to each other. Each of them taken separately and apart from the comparison is the unit of the ratio it forms with the opposite members, which are the amounts relatively to that unit and which thus represent the series of exponents. But conversely, this series is the unit for the two measures which when compared with each other are related as quanta; as such they are themselves different amounts of the unit just indicated.</p>

Each of these then is similarly to be taken as unit so that they have a series of exponents in the two, or rather indefinitely many members of the first series which are compared merely among themselves, and these exponents are the numbers resulting from comparison among themselves of the measures just named; and conversely, the comparative numbers of the measures which are now also to be taken singly as self-subsistent are the series of exponents for the members of the first series. In this way, both sides are series in which each number is firstly simply a unit to the opposite series in which it has its self-determined character as a series of exponents; secondly, each number is itself one of the exponents for each member of the opposite series; and thirdly, it is a comparative number for the other numbers of its series and as such amount, which belongs to it also as an exponent, it has its own specifically determined unit in the opposite series.</p>

In measure, however, this external aspect is not merely a quantum and a circle of quanta, but a series of numerical ratios and it is in the entirety of these that the self-determinedness of measure lies. As is the case in the being-for-self of quantum as degree, the nature of the self-subsistent measure is converted into this externality of itself. Its self-relation is in the first place an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation and therefore its indifference to an other consists only in the quantum. It is into this externality therefore that its qualitative side falls and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relationship to its other&nbsp;</em>becomes that quantitative mode of relationship which constitutes the specific determination of this self-subsistent measure, a mode which is determined just as much by the other as by the measure itself; and this other is a series of quanta and the measure is reciprocally a quantum. But this relation in which two specific measures specify themselves in a third something, the exponent, also implies that the one has not passed into the other; that therefore there is not only one negation, but that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">both&nbsp;</em>are posited as negative in the relation, and since in this each preserves itself as indifferent towards the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its negation&nbsp;</em>is also in turn&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negated.</em>This their qualitative unity is thus a self-subsistent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive&nbsp;</em>unit. It is only as exclusive that the exponents, which are primarily comparative numbers of the members of the series, have in them their genuinely specific determinateness relatively to one another, and their difference thus acquires a qualitative nature. But this difference has a quantitative basis: first, the self-subsistent measure is related to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality&nbsp;</em>of its qualitatively other side only because in this relationship it is, at the same time, indifferent; secondly, the neutral relationship, in virtue of its quantitative aspect, is now not simply an alteration but is posited as a negation of the negation and as an exclusive unit. Consequently, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affinity&nbsp;</em>of a self-subsistent measure with the measures of the other side is no longer an indifferent relationship but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elective affinity.</em></p>

For a chemical substance has its specific determinateness essentially in its relation to its other and exists only as this difference from it. Furthermore, this specific relation is bound up with quantity and is at the same time the relation, not only to a single other but to a series of specifically different others opposed to it. The combinations with this series are based on a so-called affinity with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">every&nbsp;</em>member of the series; but along with this indifference each member is at the same time exclusive towards the others and it is this correlation of opposed determinations which we have still to consider. It is, however, not only in the sphere of chemistry that the specific relation is represented in a circle of combinations; the individual note, too, only has meaning in relationship and combination with another note and with a series of others. The harmony or disharmony in such a circle of combinations constitutes its qualitative nature which is at the same time based on quantitative ratios; these form a series of exponents and are the ratios of the two specific ratios which each of the combined notes is in its own self. The individual note is the key of a system, but again it is equally an individual member in the system of every other key. The harmonies are exclusive elective affinities whose characteristic quality is equally dissolved again in the externality of a merely quantitative progression. What it is, however, that constitutes the principle of a measure for those affinities which (whether chemical or musical or what else) are elective affinities between and in opposition to the others, will be the subject of a further Remark in connection with chemical affinity; but this higher question is very closely bound up with the specific nature of the strictly qualitative aspect and belongs to the particular concrete natural sciences.</p>

In elective affinity as an exclusive, qualitative correlation, the relationship is rid of this quantitative difference. The next determination which offers itself is this; that in accordance with the difference of the amounts, that is, of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive</em>&nbsp;magnitude, of the substances of the one series required for the neutralisation of a substance in the other series, the elective affinity of the latter substance would also be directed towards the substances of the first series with all of which it has an affinity. The exclusion which would thereby be established in the form of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">firmer&nbsp;</em>holding together against other possibilities of combination, would appear, thus transformed, in a proportionately greater&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensity&nbsp;</em>in virtue of the previously demonstrated identity of the forms of extensive and intensive magnitude, the quantitative determinateness being one and the same in both forms. However, this sudden conversion of the one-sided form of extensive magnitude into its other, intensive form, makes no difference to the nature of the fundamental determination, which is one and the same quantum; consequently, no real exclusion would, in fact, result therefrom and there could take place equally well either only one combination, or a combination of an indefinite number of substances, provided that the portions of them entering into the combination corresponded to the required quantum in accordance with the ratios existing between them.</p>

In this aspect of exclusive relations, numbers have lost their continuity with one another and their fluid combinatory nature; the relationship is one of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more or less,&nbsp;</em>which acquires a negative character and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preference</em>which one exponent has over another does not remain confined to the quantitative determinateness. But equally, too, there co-exists this other aspect which again makes it a matter of indifference that a substance receives the neutralising quantum from several substances of the opposed series and from each according to its specific ratio relatively to the others; the exclusive, negative relation is thus at the same time adversely affected by the quantitative aspect. The effect of this is an actual conversion of an indifferent, merely quantitative relationship into a qualitative one, and conversely, a transition from a specifically determined relation into a merely external one &mdash; a series of relations which are sometimes of a merely quantitative nature and sometimes are specific relations and measures.</p>

Acids and alkalis or bases generally, appear to be intrinsically determinate things just as they are; but the fact is that they are incomplete elements of bodies, constituents which strictly speaking do not exist for themselves but only as a tendency to get rid of their isolatedness by combining with another constituent. Further, the difference in virtue of which 1 they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent,&nbsp;</em>does not consist in this immediate quality but in the peculiar quantitative mode of the relationship. This, namely, is not restricted to the chemical opposition of acid and alkali or base in general, but is a specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measure of saturation</em>and consists in the specific determinateness of the quantity of the substances which neutralise each other. This specific quantity required for saturation constitutes the qualitative nature of a substance; it makes it what it is on its own account and the number which expresses this is essentially one of several exponents for an opposed unit. A substance of this kind has a so-called affinity with another. If this connection remained of a purely qualitative nature, then, as in the case of the magnetic poles or positive and negative electricity, the one determinateness would be only the negative of the other and both sides would not at the same time show themselves to be indifferent towards each other. But because the connection has also a quantitative side, each of these substances is capable of neutralising itself with more than one and is not restricted only to the one to which it is opposed. It is not only an acid and an alkali or base which are in relation, but acids and alkalis or bases which are related to one another. They are specifically distinguished from each other primarily according to whether one acid, for example, requires a greater amount of an alkali for its saturation than another acid does. But the independent, self-determined character of the substances is displayed in the exclusiveness of the relation between the affinities, one having a preference over another in that one acid can by itself enter into combination with any alkali, and conversely. Thus the cardinal difference between two acids consists in one of them having a closer affinity to a base than the other, i.e., in a so-called elective affinity.</p>

From this it follows that the amounts of two alkaline bases required for the saturation of an acid must be in the same ratio to saturate another acid; and in general, when for one alkali, taken as unit, the series of numerical ratios has been determined in which the various acids saturate it, then this series is the same for any other alkali, though the different alkalis must be taken in different amounts relatively to one another-amounts which again on their part form a similar fixed series of exponents for each of the opposite acids since they are related to any one acid in the same ratio as to any other. Fischer was the first to extract these series in their simplicity from the works of Richter and Berthollet. Since that was written, our knowledge of the numerical ratios of mixtures of chemical elements has been greatly expanded in every direction and to consider it here would be a digression, all the more so because this empirical expansion which is in part only hypothetical remains confined within the same group of concepts. We may however add a few remarks on the categories employed here and also on the views about chemical elective affinity itself and its relation to the quantitative aspect as well as the attempt to base this on specific physical qualities.</p>

If two acids act on an alkali and the one which has a greater affinity for it is also present in the requisite amount for saturating it, then according to the concept of elective affinity this is the only saturation which occurs; the other acid remains quite inactive and is excluded from the neutral combination. According to the concept of the activity of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">chemical mass,</em>&nbsp;on the other hand, each of the two acids is active in a proportion which is composed of the amounts of the acids present and their saturation capacity or so-called affinity. Berthollet&#39;s investigations have indicated in greater detail the circumstances in which the activity of the chemical mass is nullified and one acid (the one with a stronger affinity) appears to expel and to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclude&nbsp;</em>the action of the other acid (with a weaker affinity) that is, appears to be active in the sense of elective affinity. He has shown that this exclusion takes place in certain<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">circumstances,&nbsp;</em>such as strength of cohesion, or the insolubility in water of the salts formed, but the qualitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nature&nbsp;</em>of the agents as such does not come into play; and the action of these circumstances can in turn be nullified by other circumstances, for example, by temperature. With the removal of these obstacles the chemical mass enters unimpeded into activity and what appeared as a purely qualitative exclusion, as an elective affinity, proves to depend only on external modifications.</p>

The views of Berthollet are taken up and repeated literally, only decked out in the metaphysics peculiar to an uncritical reflection, the categories of which are therefore all that offer themselves for a more detailed consideration. The theory goes beyond the limits of experience and, on the one hand, invents sensuous images such as are not given in experience and on the other hand, applies categories of thought, in both cases making itself a subject for logical criticism. We propose therefore to hear what he has to say about the theory in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Textbook&nbsp;</em>itself. Now there we read &#39;that one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">must imagine&nbsp;</em>that in a uniformly mixed liquid, each atom of the dissolved substance is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surrounded&nbsp;</em>by an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equal number&nbsp;</em>of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">atoms&nbsp;</em>of the solvent; and if several substances are dissolved together they must&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">share between them the interstices&nbsp;</em>between the atoms of the solvent, so that with a uniform mixture of the liquid there is produced a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry in the arrangement&nbsp;</em>of the atoms such that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all the atoms&nbsp;</em>of the individual substances are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">uniformly arranged in relation to the atoms&nbsp;</em>of the other bodies; it could therefore be said that the solution is characterised by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry in the arrangement&nbsp;</em>of the atoms, and the combination by the fixed proportions.&#39; This is then illustrated by an example of compounds formed when sulphuric acid is added to a solution of copper chloride; but the example certainly does not demonstrate that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">atoms&nbsp;</em>exist; neither does it show that a number of atoms of the dissolved substances&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surround&nbsp;</em>atoms of the fluid, nor that free atoms of the two acids&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arrange themselves around&nbsp;</em>the atoms which remain combined (with the copper oxide), nor that there exists a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry&nbsp;</em>in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">position and arrangement,&nbsp;</em>nor that interstices between the atoms exist &mdash; and least of all that the dissolved substances&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">share among themselves the interstices&nbsp;</em>between the atoms of the solvent. This would mean that the atoms of the dissolved substances take up their positions where the solvent is not &mdash; for the interstices between the atoms of the solvent are spaces&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empty&nbsp;</em>of it &mdash; and hence that the dissolved substances are not present in the solvent, but rather&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">are outside&nbsp;</em>it, even if the solvent is arranged around them or they around it, and it is also certain therefore that they are not dissolved by it. One fails therefore to see why it is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary&nbsp;</em>to form such conceptions which are not empirically demonstrated, are in essence directly self-contradictory and are not corroborated in any other way. Corroboration could be provided only by a consideration of these conceptions themselves, i.e. by metaphysics, which is logic; but this cannot confirm them any more than experience can &mdash; on the contrary! For the rest, Berzelius admits what was also said above, that Berthollet&#39;s propositions are not opposed to the theory of fixed proportions, although he does add that they are also not opposed to the views of the corpuscular theory, i.e. the ideas mentioned above of atoms, of the filling of the interstices of the solvent by the atoms of the solid substances, and so on; this latter baseless metaphysics however, has essentially nothing to do with the proportions of saturation as such.</p>

When Berzelius, then, notwithstanding the fact that his theory of proportions is wholly and solely a determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amounts,&nbsp;</em>nevertheless also speaks of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degrees&nbsp;</em>of affinity&#39; in explaining Berthollet&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">chemical mass&nbsp;</em>as the sum of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree of affinity,&nbsp;</em>from the given quantity of the active substance &mdash; although Berthollet is more consistent for he uses the expression&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">capacite de saturation &mdash; then&nbsp;</em>he himself lapses into the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive&nbsp;</em>magnitude; but it is this form which is the characteristic feature of the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dynamic&nbsp;</em>philosophy which earlier on he calls &#39;the speculative philosophy of certain German schools&#39;,&#39; and emphatically rejects in favour of the excellent &#39;corpuscular theory&#39;. He there states of this dynamic philosophy that it assumes that the elements&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">interpenetrate&nbsp;</em>one another in their chemical combination, and that neutralization consists in this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mutual interpenetration;&nbsp;</em>this means nothing else than that the chemically different particles, which are interrelated as a plurality, collapse into the simplicity of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive&nbsp;</em>magnitude, a fact which also finds expression as a diminution of volume. In the corpuscular theory, on the other hand, even the atoms which are chemically&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">combined&nbsp;</em>are supposed to be preserved in the interstices, i.e.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>one another (juxtaposition); in such a relationship which is one of merely extensive magnitude, of a perpetuated amount, a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of affinity has no meaning. In the same place it is stated that for the dynamic view the phenomena of specific proportions came as something quite unforeseen; but this would be only an external, historical circumstance, apart from the fact that Richter&#39;s stoechiometric series in Fischer&#39;s compilation of them were already known to Berthollet and are quoted in the first edition of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Logic</em>which proves the nullity of the categories on which the old, like the would-be new, corpuscular theory is based. But Berzelius is in error when he judges that if &#39;the dynamic view&#39; had prevailed, the phenomenaof specific proportions would have remained &#39;for ever&#39; unknown-meaning that this view is incompatible with the determinateness of proportions. This is, in any case, only a determinateness of quantity, no matter whether in an extensive or an intensive form; so that even Berzelius, much as he adheres to the first of these forms, that of aggregate or amount [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Menge</em>], himself makes use of the conception of degrees of affinity.</p>

A partial comparison may be made between this conception and the manner of considering the effect of gravity on a moving pendulum. Through gravity the- pendulum necessarily passes into a state of rest; but this intrinsic effect of gravity itself is treated as a merely concomitant circumstance of the external resistance of the air, the thread and so on, and it is ascribed solely to friction instead of to gravity. Here it makes no difference to the nature of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>element present in elective affinity whether this is manifested in the form of these circumstances taken as its conditions, and is so interpreted. With the qualitative aspect as such there begins a new order, the specifying of which is no longer only a matter of quantitative difference.</p>

We need not here consider more closely this theory in which the phenomena of electricity and chemistry are completely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identified,&nbsp;</em>since it concerns the physical nature of substances and not merely their measure relations and it calls for mention only in so far as the distinctive character of the determinations of measure is confused by it. The theory as such must be dubbed shallow, for shallowness consists in omitting the difference between distinct terms and then treating them as identical. As for affinity, chemical processes being thus identified with electrical, and also with the phenomena of fire and light, this is reduced &#39;to neutralisation of opposite electricities. It is almost comical to find the identification of electricity and chemical action expounded in the following manner: &#39;it is true that electrical phenomena explain the action of bodies at a greater or lesser distance, their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction&nbsp;</em>before combination (i.e. a behaviour which is not yet chemical) and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fire</em>(?) caused by this combination, but they throw no light on the cause of the combination which persists with such strength&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">after&nbsp;</em>the opposite electrical condition has been destroyed;&#39; that is to say, the theory tells us that electricity is the cause of the chemical action, but about the specifically chemical nature of the chemical process electricity tells us nothing. Chemical difference as such being thus reduced to the opposition of positive and negative electricity, the different affinities of the agents on either side are determined as the order of two series of electro-posit&#39; e and electro-negative substances. In identifying electricity and chemical action it is overlooked that the former generally (and its neutralisation) is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transient&nbsp;</em>and remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to the quality of substances, whereas chemical action, especially in the process of neutralisation, embraces and alters the entire qualitative nature of substances. Equally transient within electricity is its opposition of positive and negative; this is so unstable that it is dependent on the most trivial outer circumstances and cannot be compared with the definiteness and fixity of the opposition between acids, for example, and metals, and so on.</p>

Also the further distinction&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within the series&nbsp;</em>of each of the two sides, between a more or less positive-electrical or more or less negative-electrical disposition is quite uncertain and entirely unconfirmed. But it is on the basis of the &#39;electrical dispositions&#39; of these series of substances that &#39;the electro-chemical system is to be set up, which above all would be best fitted to provide an idea of chemistry&#39;: these series are now quoted; but what their nature really is, is indicated in the remark &#39;that this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximately&nbsp;</em>the order of these substances, but so little investigation has been made into this matter, that as yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing really certain&nbsp;</em>can be ascertained about this relative order. Both the numerical ratios of the series of affinities (first made by Richter) as well as the extremely interesting reduction by Berzelius of the combinations of two substances to the simplicity of a few quantitative ratios, are absolutely independent of that hypothetical electro-chemical hotchpotch. If the experimental method has been the correct guiding star in the theory of proportions and its universal expansion since Richter, then the mixing of these great discoveries with the so-called corpuscular theory, a desert lying away from the path of experience, forms all the greater contrast with it; only this beginning, the abandoning of the principle of experience, could be the reason for taking up again and developing that idea introduced earlier, especially by Ritter, namely, the setting up of fixed classifications of electro-positive and electronegative substances, which classifications were also supposed to have a chemical significance.</p>

It is admitted that two so-called electro-negative substances such as sulphur and oxygen combine in a much more intimate way than, e.g. oxygen and copper, although the latter is electro-positive.2 Here therefore, the basis for the affinity founded on the general opposition of positive and negative electricity must give place to a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more or less&nbsp;</em>within one and the same series of electrical quality. From this it is now inferred that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree of affinity</em>&nbsp;of the substances depends therefore not only on their specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unipolarity&nbsp;</em>(with what hypothesis this determination is connected is irrelevant here; it is significant here only for the &#39;either&#39; of the positive and the &#39;or&#39; of the negative); the degree of affinity must be derived mainly from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensity&nbsp;</em>of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">polarity&nbsp;</em>generally. At this point then, the consideration of affinity passes on to the relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elective&nbsp;</em>affinity which is our chief concern; let us see then what the result now is for this subject. It is at once admitted that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of this polarity, if this does not exist merely in our imagination, does not seem to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant quality</em>&nbsp;but to depend very much on temperatures so that, after all, the result turns out to be not only that every chemical action is therefore at bottom an electrical phenomenon, but also that what seems to be an effect of so-called elective affinity is brought about&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>by an electrical polarity which in certain substances is present in greater strength than in others. The conclusion then after all this meandering in hypothetical conceptions, is that we are left with the category of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater intensity,&nbsp;</em>which is the same formal determination as elective affinity in general; and since the latter is made to depend on a greater intensity of electrical polarity, it is not a whit nearer to being put on a physical basis than it was before. But even what is here supposed to be determined as a greater specific intensity is subsequently reduced to the modifications demonstrated by Berthollet which have already been cited.</p>

Chemical substances form a system of relations with respect to saturation; saturation itself rests on the specific proportion in which the reciprocal amounts of two substances, each of which has a particular material existence, combine with each other. But there are also measure relations the moments of which are inseparable and cannot be displayed in a separate and distinct existence of their own. These are what we called earlier on,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate self-subsistent</em>&nbsp;measures and which are displayed in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific gravity of</em>&nbsp;substances. They are a ratio within the substances of weight to volume; the exponent of the ratio, which is the expression of the difference between one specific gravity and another, is a definite quantum only as a result&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of.comparison.</em>This is a relationship external to the substances in an external reflection, and is not founded on the one substance&#39;s own qualitative behaviour towards another contrasted substance. The problem would be to recognize the exponents of the ratios of the series of specific gravities as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system&nbsp;</em>based on a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rule&nbsp;</em>which would specify a merely arithmetical plurality into a series of harmonic nodes. The same demand would apply to our knowledge of the series of chemical affinities already mentioned. But the accomplishment of this task still lies a long way ahead, as far ahead as the problem of grasping the numbers of the relative distances of the planets from the sun as elements in a system of measure.</p>

When substances are chemically combined, or even form only amalgams or synsomates, there occurs also a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">neutralisation&nbsp;</em>of the specific gravities. We mentioned earlier on the fact that the volume of a mixture, even a mixture of substances remaining really indifferent chemically to each other, is not of the same magnitude as the sum of the volumes of the substances before mixing. There is a reciprocal modification in the mixture of the quantum of specific gravity with which the substances enter into the relation and in this way they indicate their qualitative behaviour towards each other. Here the quantum of specific gravity is expressed not merely as a fixed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparative number,&nbsp;</em>but as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">numerical ratio&nbsp;</em>which can be varied; and the exponents of the mixtures give series of measures the specifying principle of which is other than the numerical ratios of the specific gravities of the substances in combination. The exponents of these ratios are not exclusive determinations of measure; their progress is continuous but it contains an immanent specifying law which is distinct from the formally progressive ratios in which the amounts are combined and makes the former progress incommensurable with the latter.</p>

For the relation of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>unity, of the elective affinity to the other neutralities, no further principle of specification has offered itself; the specification resides only in the quantitative determination of affinity in general, according to which the amounts which neutralise themselves are specific and therefore stand opposed to other relative elective affinities of their moments. But further, because the fundamental determination is quantitative, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive</em>&nbsp;elective affinity also continues itself into the opposed neutralities; and this continuity is not only an external relation of the different ratios of the neutralities in the form of a comparison, but the neutrality is, as such,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separable into the moments&nbsp;</em>which united to produce it, since it is as self-subsistent somethings that these enter into relation indifferently with one or the other of the opposite series, although combining in different, specifically determined amounts. This measure, based on such a relation, is thus infected with its own indifference; it is in its own self something external and alterable in its relation to itself.</p>

These relations differ from the affinities of the kind above-mentioned in which a self-subsistent measure relates itself to self-subsistent measures of a different quality and to a series of such. They take place in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one and the same&nbsp;</em>substrate within the same moments of the neutrality; the self-repelling measure develops other, merely quantitatively different relations which likewise form affinities and measures, alternating with those which remain only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitatively&nbsp;</em>different. They form in this way a nodal line of measures on a scale of more and less.</p>

Such a being-for-self, because it is at the same time essentially a relation of quanta, is open to externality and to quantitative alteration; it has a range within which it remains indifferent to this alteration and does not change its quality. But there enters a point in this quantitative alteration at which the quality is changed and the quantum shows itself as specifying, so that the altered quantitative relation is converted into a measure, and thus into a new quality, a new something. The relation which has taken the place of the first is determined by this, partly according to the qualitative identity of the moments which are in affinity, and partly according to the quantitative continuity. But because the difference falls into this quantitative aspect, the relation between the new something and its predecessor is one of indifference; their difference is the external one of quantum. The new something has therefore not emerged from or developed out of its predecessor but directly from itself, that is, from the inner specifying unity which has not yet entered into existence. The new quality or new something is subjected to the same progressive alteration, and so on to infinity.</p>

From this side, the alteration is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gradual</em>&nbsp;But the gradualness concerns merely the external side of the alteration, not its qualitative aspect; the preceding quantitative relation which is infinitely near the following one is still a different qualitative existence. On the qualitative side, therefore, the gradual, merely quantitative progress which is not in itself a limit, is absolutely interrupted; the new quality in its merely quantitative relationship is, relatively to the vanishing quality, an indifferent, indeterminate other, and the transition is therefore a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">leap;&nbsp;</em>both are posited as completely external to each other. People fondly try to make an alteration&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehensible&nbsp;</em>by means of the gradualness of the transition; but the truth is that gradualness is an alteration which is merely indifferent, the opposite of qualitative change. In gradualness too, the connection of the two realities, whether these are taken to be states or self-subsistent things, is eliminated; gradualness necessarily implies that neither of the two is the limit of the other but that each is completely external to the other. In this way there is eliminated the very factor which is necessary for an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">understanding&nbsp;</em>of change, although little enough is required for that purpose.</p>

It is on the one hand a merely quantitative progress and regress, a perpetual adding or subtracting, so that each number has the same<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arithmetical&nbsp;</em>relation to the one before it and after it, as these have to their predecessors and successors, and so on. But the numbers so formed also have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>relation to other numbers preceding and following them, being either an integral multiple of one of them or else a power or a root.

There is a sudden interruption of the succession of merely indifferent relations which do not alter the preceding specific reality or do not even form any such, and although the succession is continued quantitatively in the same manner, a specific relation breaks in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per saltum.</em></p>

These products are distinguished from one another not merely by a more or less, and they are not already present, or only perhaps in a weaker degree, in the proportions close to the nodal proportions, but are bound up with these nodes themselves. For example, different oxides of nitrogen and nitric acids having essentially different qualities are formed only when oxygen and nitrogen are combined in certain specific proportions, and no such specific compounds are formed by the intermediate proportions. Metal oxides, e.g. the lead oxides, are formed at certain quantitative points of oxidation and are distinguished by colours and other qualities. They do not pass gradually into one another; the proportions lying in between these nodes do not produce a neutral or a specific substance. Without having passed through the intervening stages, a specific compound appears which is based on a measure relation and possesses characteristic qualities. Again, water when its temperature is altered does not merely get more or less hot but passes through from the liquid into either the solid or gaseous states; these states do not appear gradually; on the contrary, each new state appears as a leap, suddenly interrupting and checking the gradual succession of temperature changes at these points. Every birth and death, far from being a progressive gradualness, is an interruption of it and is the leap from a quantitative into a qualitative alteration.</p>

But we have seen that the alterations of being in general are not only the transition of one magnitude into another, but a transition from quality into quantity and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa</em>, a becoming-other which is an interruption of gradualness and the production of something qualitatively different from the reality which preceded it. Water, in cooling, does not gradually harden as if it thickened like porridge, gradually solidifying until it reached the consistency of ice; it suddenly solidifies, all at once. It can remain quite fluid even at freezing point if it is standing undisturbed, and then a slight shock will bring it into the solid state</span>.</p>

Similarly with the gradual disappearance of something, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being</em>&nbsp;or other which takes its place is likewise assumed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">really there</em>, only not observable, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there</em>, too, not in the sense of being implicitly or ideally contained in the first something, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">really there</em>, only not observable. In this way, the form of the in-itself, the inner being of something before it actually exists, is transformed into a smallness of an outer existence, and the essential difference, that of the Notion, is converted into an external difference of mere magnitude. The attempt to explain coming-to-be or ceasing-to-be on the basis of gradualness of the alteration is tedious like any tautology; what comes to be or ceases to be is assumed as already complete and in existence beforehand and the alteration is turned into a mere change of an external difference, with the result that the explanation is in fact a mere tautology. The intellectual difficulty attendant on such an attempted explanation comes from the qualitative transition from something into its other in general, and then into its opposite; but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration</em>&nbsp;are misrepresented as the indifferent, external determinations of the quantitative sphere</span>.</p>

Thus states, too, acquire through their quantitative difference, other things being assumed equal, a distinct qualitative character. With the expansion of the state and an increased number of citizens, the laws and the constitution acquire a different significance. The state has its own measure of magnitude and when this is exceeded this mere change of size renders it liable to instability and disruption under that same constitution which was its good fortune and its strength before its expansion.</p>

Magnitude is that side of determinate being through which it can be caught up in a seemingly harmless entanglement which can destroy it.</p>

Measure in the nodal line of measures is at the same time posited as specifying and the abstract measureless raises itself into a qualitative determinateness; the new measure relation into which the original one passes is, with respect to this, measureless, but in its own self it is equally a quality on its own account. Thus there is posited the alternation of specific existences with one another and of these equally with relations remaining merely quantitative &mdash; and so on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ad infinitum.&nbsp;</em>What therefore is present in this transition is both the negation of the specific relations and the negation of the quantitative progress itself &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>. The qualitative infinite, as simply a determinate being, was the eruption of the infinite in the finite as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate transition&nbsp;</em>and vanishing of the latter in its beyond. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>infinite on the other hand is, simply by virtue of its determinateness, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuity of</em>&nbsp;the quantum, a continuity of it into its beyond. The qualitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite becomes&nbsp;</em>the infinite; the quantitative finite is in its own self its beyond and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">points beyond itself.&nbsp;</em>But this infinity of the specification of measure&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posits&nbsp;</em>both the qualitative and the quantitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as sublating</em>themselves in each other, and hence posits their first, immediate unity, which is measure as such, as returned into itself and therefore as itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>The transition of the qualitative, of one specific existence, into another, is such that all that occurs is an alteration of the specific magnitude of a ratio. Hence the alteration of the qualitative itself into the qualitative is posited as an external and indifferent change, as a coming together with itself; moreover, the quantitative, in being converted into the qualitative, into that which is determined in and for itself, sublates itself. This unity which thus continues itself into itself in its alternating measures is the truly persisting, self-subsistent material substance or thing.</p>

In measure, the thing itself is already in itself the unity of its qualitative and quantitative moments, the two moments which constitute the element of difference within the general sphere of being and of which one is the beyond of the other; in this way the perennial substrate has directly in its own self the determination of affirmative infinity.&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[b]</span>&nbsp;This self-sameness of the substrate is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited</em>&nbsp;in the fact that the qualitative self-subsistent measures into which the specifying unity is dispersed consist only of quantitative differences, so that the substrate continues itself into this differentiation of itself;&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[c]</span>&nbsp;in the infinite progress of the nodal series there is posited the continuation of the qualitative moment into the quantitative progress as into an indifferent alteration, but equally too, there is posited the negation of the qualitative moment contained therein and hence of the merely quantitative externality too.

Now such relations are determined only as nodal points of one and the same substrate. Consequently, the measures and the self-subsistent things posited with them are reduced to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">states.&nbsp;</em>The alteration is only change of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">state,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>of the transition is posited as remaining the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>in the process.</p>

Measure is, in the first instance, only the immediate unity of quality and quantity as an ordinary quantum which is, however, specific. As thus a specific quantity which is related not to another but to itself, it is essentially a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio.&nbsp;</em>It therefore also contains its moments as sublated and undivided within itself; as is always the case in a Notion, the difference in the ratio is present in such a manner that each of its moments is itself a unity of quality and quantity. The difference therefore is real and yields a number of measure relations which, as formal totalities in themselves, are selfsubsistent. The two series formed by the sides of these ratios are the same constant arrangement for each individual member which, as belonging to one side, enters into relationship with all the members of the opposite series.</p>

In this unity of the substrate with itself the measure determination is sublated and its quality is an external state determined by the quantum. This process is equally the progressive determination of measure in its realisation and also the reduction of measure to the status of a moment.</p>

But the indifference is this fixed measure, the implicit, absolute limit, only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to those differences in such a manner that it would not be in its own self a quantum or opposed in any way, either as a sum or even as an exponent, to other quanta whether sums or indifferences. It is only the abstract determinateness which falls into the indifference; the two quanta, in order that they may be posited in it as moments, are variable, indifferent, greater or smaller relatively to one another. Bounded however by the fixed limit of their sum, they are related to each other not externally but negatively, and this now is the qualitative determination of their relationship. They are consequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inversely proportional.&nbsp;</em>This relation is distinguished from the earlier formal inverted relation or inverse ratio by the fact that here the whole is a real substrate and each of the two sides is posited as having to be itself in principle [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>] this whole.</p>

The substrate itself, as an indifference, is likewise in itself the unity of both qualities; therefore each side of the relation, too, contains both sides within itself and is distinguished from the other side only by a more of the one quality and a less of the other, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa.&nbsp;</em>The one quality is through its quantum only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preponderant&nbsp;</em>in the one side, and so, too, the other quality in the other side.</p>

As formal, this relation recurs in the two distinct sides. These sides thus continue themselves into each other also in respect of their qualitative determinations; each quality is self-related in the other and is present in each of the two sides, only in a different quantum. Their quantitative difference is that indifference in accordance with which they continue themselves into each other and this continuation as the self-sameness of the qualities is in each of the two unities. The sides, however, each as the whole of the two determinations and hence containing the indifference itself, are thus at the same time posited as self-subsistent relatively to each other.</p>

Consequently, the difference between them is posited in the first place as sublated, therefore as only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative,&nbsp;</em>but not as the self-repulsion of the indifference, and the indifference is not posited as self-determining but as being determinate and determined only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally</em>.&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[b]</span>&nbsp;The two moments are in an inverted quantitative relation-a to and fro in the scale of magnitude; but this fluctuation is determined not by the indifference, which is just the indifference of this fluctuation, but is determined herewith only externally. The principle of determination resides not in the indifference, but in something lying outside it. The absolute, as indifference, has in this aspect the second defect of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>form, namely that the determinateness of the difference is not determined by the absolute itself; just as it has the first defect in the fact that the differences simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">emerge&nbsp;</em>in it, that is to say, the absolute&#39;s positing is immediate in character, is not the mediation of the absolute with itself.&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[c]</span>&nbsp;The quantitative determinateness of the moments which are now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>of the relation constitutes this mode of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence;&nbsp;</em>through this indifference their determinate being is freed from the transition of the qualitative sphere. But in distinction from this their real being, they have an implicit subsistence in the fact that they are<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves&nbsp;</em>the indifference itself, each being itself the unity of the two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualities&nbsp;</em>into which the qualitative moment splits itself. The difference between the two sides is restricted to this, that one quality is posited in the one side with a more and in the other with a less, and the other quality similarly, but conversely. Hence each side is in its own self the totality of the indifference. Each of the two qualities taken singly on its own account also remains the same sum which the indifference is; it continues itself out of the one side into the other and is not bounded by the quantitative limit which is thereby posited in it. In consequence of this the determinations come into immediate opposition and this develops itself into a contradiction which we have now to consider.</p>

If the two qualities are self-subsistent &mdash; taken, say, as if they were sensuous things independent of each other &mdash; then the whole determinateness of indifference falls asunder; their unity and totality would be empty names. But they are at the same time expressly determined as comprised in a single unity, as inseparable, each as having meaning and reality only in this one qualitative relation to the other. But now,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">because their quantitativity is simply and solely of this qualitative nature, each reaches only as far as the other.&nbsp;</em>If the qualities are regarded simply as distinct quanta, then the one would reach beyond the other and would have in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more&nbsp;</em>an indifferent determinate being which the other would not have.

Each of these hypothetical factors vanishes, whether it is supposed to be<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond or equal to&nbsp;</em>the other. This vanishing appears to quantitative conception as a disturbance of the equilibrium so that the one factor becomes greater than the other; thus there is posited the sublating of the quality of the other and its lack of any support. One factor becomes preponderant as the other diminishes with an accelerated velocity and is overpowered by the first, which therefore constitutes itself the sole self-subsistent quality; but this being so, there are no longer two specific moments and factors but only the one whole.</p>

This example exhibits primarily only two qualities in inverse relation to each other, not two sides, each of which is itself the unity of both and their inverse relation. The fact, the inverse relation, rests on a firm empirical foundation, but the theoretical explanation of it involves a consequence which is overlooked, namely the destruction of the basic fact; or if, as is proper, the fact is retained it escapes notice that the theory proves to be meaningless in face of the fact. The ignoring of this consequence allows the fact and the theory conflicting with it to exist calmly side by side. The simple fact is that in the elliptical motion of the celestial bodies their velocity is accelerated as they approach perihelion and retarded as they approach aphelion. The quantitative side of this fact has been accurately ascertained by the untiring diligence of observation, and further, it has been reduced to its simple law and formula.</p>

For the purpose of a so-called explanation of the phenomenon and its law a centripetal and a centrifugal force are assumed as qualitative moments of the curvilinear motion. Qualitatively, their difference consists in the opposed direction of the moments, and quantitatively, the moments being determined as unequal, in the fact that as the one increases the other is supposed to decrease, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa;&nbsp;</em>then further, that their relationship is reversed again so that after a period during which the centripetal force has been increasing and the centrifugal force decreasing, a point is reached where the former decreases and the latter increases. But this way of representing the matter is contradicted by the essentially qualitative relation between their respective determinatenesses which makes their separation from each other completely out of the question. Each has meaning only with reference to the other; consequently, in so far as the one had an excess over the other, to that extent it would have no relation to it and the other would no longer exist. If it is assumed that one of them is at one time greater than the other, being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">related&nbsp;</em>to it as the greater to the smaller, then what was said above applies, namely, that the greater would acquire absolute preponderance and the other would vanish; the other would be posited as a vanishing moment without any support; and nothing would be altered by supposing the vanishing to take place only gradually any more than by supposing that by as much as the vanishing moment decreases in magnitude the other increases, for the latter, too, is destroyed with the former, since it is what it is, only in so far as the other is. It requires but little consideration to see that if, for example, as is alleged, the body&#39;s centripetal force increases as it approaches perihelion, while the centrifugal force is supposed to decrease proportionately, the latter<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">would no longer be able&nbsp;</em>to tear the body away from the former and to set it again at a distance from its central body; on the contrary, for once the former has gained the preponderance, the other is overpowered and the body is carried towards its central body with accelerated velocity. Just as conversely, if the centrifugal force gains the upper hand when infinitely near to aphelion, it is equally contradictory that now, in the aphelion itself, it should be overpowered by the weaker force.</p>

The conclusion which follows from the vanishing of one or the other direction and hence of the elliptical motion altogether, is ignored and concealed because of the undeniable fact that this motion does go on and pass from the accelerated into the retarded velocity. The assumed transformation of the weakness of the centripetal force in aphelion into a preponderant strength over the centrifugal force, and conversely in perihelion, implies first the conclusion arrived at above, namely, that each side of the inverse relation is in its own self the whole inverse relation; for the side of the motion from aphelion to perihelion (when the centripetal force is supposed to be preponderant) is still supposed to contain the centrifugal force which, however, diminishes as the other increases, while on the side of the retarded motion the centrifugal force is assumed to be present in that same inverse relation in an ever-increasing preponderance over the centripetal force. Consequently, on neither side has either force vanished but only become increasingly smaller up to the point of its transformation into a preponderance over the other. All that recurs then on either side is the defect characteristic of this inverse relation, namely, either each force is credited with an independent self-subsistence, the pair being merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>associated in a motion (as in the parallelogram of forces), in which case the unity of the Notion, the nature of the thing itself, is left out of account; or else, since each is qualitatively related to the other by the Notion, neither can attain an indifferent independent subsistence in face of the other, a subsistence supposedly imparted to it by a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more.&nbsp;</em>The form of intensity, the so-called dynamic factor, does not help, because this too has its determinateness in quantum and consequently can express only as much force (which is the measure of its existence) as is opposed to it by the opposite force. Secondly, this sudden change round from a preponderance into its opposite implies the alternation of the qualitative determination of positive and negative; an increase in the one means an equivalent loss in the other. In the theory, the inseparable qualitative connectedness of this qualitative opposition is distorted into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">succession in time;</em>&nbsp;but it fails thereby to give an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">explanation&nbsp;</em>of this alternation and more particularly of this distortion itself. The semblance of unity which is still implied in the increasing of one side with an equivalent decreasing of the other vanishes here completely; what is alleged is a merely external succession of the sides which only contradicts what is necessarily implied in their qualitative connectedness, namely that with the preponderance of one side the other must disappear.</p>

This mode of explanation was supposed to form a basis for the natural philosophy of physiology, nosology and also zoology, but the confused hotchpotch of nonsense in which it became entangled through the uncritical use of these determinations of the Notion soon led to the abandonment in these spheres of this formalism which, however, is practised without restraint in the other sciences, particularly in physical astronomy.</p>

If we stop short at the abstraction [of substance] then it is a matter of complete indifference what something looked like in reality before it was swallowed up in this abyss. But when substance is conceived as indifference, it is tied up with the need for determining it and for taking this determining into consideration; it is not to remain Spinoza&#39;s substance, the sole determination of which is the negative one that everything is absorbed in it. With Spinoza, the moment of difference &mdash; attributes, thought and extension, then the modes too, the affections, and every other determination &mdash; is introduced quite empirically; it is intellect, itself a mode, which is the source of the differentiation.</p>

But by the determination of substance as indifference, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference too,</em>&nbsp;comes to be reflected on; whereas with Spinoza, the difference is an external, and more precisely a quantitative difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only by implication,&nbsp;</em>now it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as such. The indifference does indeed, like substance, remain immanent in the differentiated moments, but only abstractly so, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly;&nbsp;</em>the difference is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>&nbsp;immanent in the indifference, for as quantitative it is rather the opposite of immanence, and the quantitative indifference is rather the self-externality of the unity. Thus the difference is also not grasped qualitatively; substance is not determined as selfdifferentiating, not as subject. The immediate consequence with respect to the category of indifference itself is that in it the difference of quantitative or qualitative determination falls apart as we found in the explication of indifference; it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dissolution of measure,&nbsp;</em>in which both moments were directly posited as one.</p>

It reveals itself as still belonging to the sphere of being through the fact that, determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent,&nbsp;</em>it still contains difference as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external,</em>quantitative determination; this is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being,&nbsp;</em>contrasted with which absolute indifference is determined as being only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>the absolute, not the absolute grasped as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality</em>. In other words, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external reflection&nbsp;</em>which stops short at conceiving the differences&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves&nbsp;</em>or in the absolute as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one and the same,</em>&nbsp;thinking of them as only indifferently distinguished, not as intrinsically distinct from one another. The further step which requires to be made here is to grasp that this reflection of the differences into their unity is not merely the product of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>reflection of the subjective thinker, but that it is the very nature of the differences of this unity to sublate themselves, with the result that their unity proves to be absolute negativity, its indifference to be just as much indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to itself,&nbsp;</em>to its own indifference, as it is indifferent to otherness.</p>

It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>the totality in which every determination of being is sublated and contained; it is thus the substrate, but at first only in the one-sided determination of the in-itself, and consequently the differences, namely, the quantitative difference and the inverse ratio of factors, are present in it only in an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>manner. As thus the contradiction of itself and its determinedness, of its implicit determination and its posited determinateness, it is the negative totality whose determinatenesses have sublated themselves in themselves and in so doing have sublated this fundamental one-sidedness of theirs, their [merely] implicit being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ansichsein</em>]. The result is that indifference is now posited as what it in fact is, namely a simple and infinite, negative relation-to-self, its inherent incompatibility with itself, a repelling of itself from itself. The process of determining and being determined is not a transition, nor an external alteration, nor an emergence of determinations in the indifference, but is its own self-relating which is the negativity of itself, of its [merely] implicit being.</p>

The determining then is of a different nature from the determining in the sphere of being, and the determinations of essence have a different character from the determinatenesses of being.

Accordingly, in so far as the distinction is made of an essential and an unessential side in something [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Dasein</em>], this distinction is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>posited, a separation of one part of it from another that does not affect the something itself, a division which has its origin in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third.&nbsp;</em>Such a division does not settle what is essential and what is unessential.

Thus being, or determinate being, has not preserved itself as an other &mdash; for we are in the sphere of essence &mdash; and the immediate that is still distinguished from essence is not merely an unessential determinate being but the immediate that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself&nbsp;</em>a nullity; it is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-essence, illusory&nbsp;</em>being.</p>

Scepticism did not permit itself to say &#39;It is&#39;; modern idealism did not permit itself to regard knowledge as a knowing of the thing-in-itself; the illusory being of scepticism was supposed to lack any foundation of being, and in idealism the thing-in-itself was not supposed to enter into knowledge. But at the same time scepticism admitted a multitude of determinations of its illusory being, or rather its illusory being had for content the entire manifold wealth of the world. In idealism, too, Appearance embraces within itself the range of these manifold determinatenesses.</span></p>

This content, therefore, may well have no being, no thing-in-itself at its base; it remains on its own account as it is; the content has only been transferred from being into an illusory being, so that the latter has within itself those manifold determinatenesses, which are immediate, simply affirmative, and mutually related as others. Illusory being is, therefore, itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately</em>&nbsp;determinate. It can have this or that content; whatever content it has, illusory being does not posit this itself but has it immediately. The various forms of idealism, Leibnizian, Kantian, Fichtean, and others, have not advanced beyond being as determinateness, have not advanced beyond this immediacy, any more than scepticism did. Scepticism permits the content of its illusory being to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given</em>&nbsp;to it; whatever content it is supposed to have, for scepticism it is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">monad</em>&nbsp;of Leibnitz evolves its ideas and representations out of itself; but it is not the power that generates and binds them together, rather do they arise in the monad like bubbles; they are indifferent and immediate over against one another and the same in relation to the monad itself. Similarly,&nbsp;<a name="HL2_397"></a>the Kantian Appearance is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given</em>&nbsp;content of perception; it presupposes affections, determinations of the subject, which are immediate relatively to themselves and to the subject. It may well be that the infinite obstacle of Fichte&#39;s idealism has no underlying thing-in-itself, so that it becomes purely a determinateness in the ego; but for the ego, this determinateness which it appropriates and whose externality it sublates is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limitation</em>&nbsp;of the ego, which it can transcend but which has in it an element of indifference, so that although the limitation is on the ego, it contains an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;non-being of the ego.</span></p>

Being has preserved itself in essence in so far as the latter in its infinite negativity has this equality with itself; it is through this that essence itself is being. The immediacy of the determinateness in illusory being over against essence is consequently nothing other than essence&#39;s own immediacy; but the immediacy is not simply affirmative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiend</em>], but is the purely mediated or reflected immediacy that is illusory being-being, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as&nbsp;</em>being, but only as the determinateness of being as opposed to mediation; being as a moment.</p>

This coincidence with itself is, in general, simple equality-with-self, immediacy. But this coincidence is not a transition of the negation into equality-with-self as into its otherness: on the contrary, reflection is transition as sublating of the transition; for reflection is immediate coincidence of the negative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself.&nbsp;</em>This coincidence is thus first, equality-with-self or immediacy; but secondly, this immediacy is the equality of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the negative&nbsp;</em>with itself, hence self-negating equality, the immediacy that is in itself the negative, the negative of itself, that consists in being that which it is not.</p>

This immediacy which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">return</em>&nbsp;of the negative into itself, is that immediacy which constitutes the determinateness of illusory being and which previously seemed to be the starting point of the reflective moment. But this immediacy, instead of being able to form the starting point is, on the contrary, immediacy only as the return or as reflection itself. Reflection therefore is the movement that starts or returns only in so far as the negative has already returned into itself.</p>

Furthermore, this immediacy is the sublated negation and the sublated return-into-self. Reflection, as sublating the negative, is a sublating of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its other,</em>&nbsp;of immediacy. Since, therefore, it is immediacy as a returning movement, as a coincidence of the negative with itself, it is equally a negative of the negative as negative. Thus it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing.&nbsp;</em>Or immediacy, as a returning movement, is only the negative of itself, only this, to be not immediacy; but reflection is the sublating of the negative of itself, it is a coincidence with itself; it therefore sublates its positing, and since in its positing it sublates its positing, it is a presupposing. Reflection, in its presupposing, determines the return-into-self as the negative of itself, as that, the sublating of which is essence. The presupposing is the manner in which it relates itself to itself, but to itself as the negative of itself; only thus is it the self-relating negativity that remains internal to itself. Immediacy presents itself simply and solely as a return and is that negative which is the illusory being of the beginning, the illusory being which is negated by the return. Accordingly, the return of essence is its self-repulsion. In other words, reflection-into-self is essentially the presupposing of that from which it is the return.</p>

It presupposes itself and the sublating of this presupposition is essence itself; conversely, this sublating of its presupposition is the presupposition itself. Reflection therefore finds<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">before it&nbsp;</em>an immediate which it transcends and from which it is the return. But this return is only the presupposing of what reflection finds before it. What is thus found only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comes to be&nbsp;</em>through being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">left behind;&nbsp;</em>its immediacy is sublated immediacy. Conversely, the sublated immediacy is the return-into-self,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the coming-to-itself&nbsp;</em>of essence, simple, self-equal being. Hence this coming-to-itself is the sublating of itself and is the self-repelling, presupposing reflection, and its self-repelling is the coming-to-itself of reflection.</p>

But external or real reflection presupposes itself as sublated, as the negative of itself In this determination it is doubled: it is what is presupposed, or reflection-into-self, which is the immediate; and also it is reflection that is negatively self-related; it is related to itself as to its non-being.</p>

Its relationship to its presupposition is such that the latter is the negative of reflection, but so that this negative as negative is sublated.

But the fact that what is thus presupposed is a negative or is posited does not concern it; this determinateness belongs only to the positing reflection, but in the presupposing the positedness is present only as sublated. The determinations posited by the external reflection in the immediate are to that extent external to the latter. This external reflection in the sphere of being was the infinite; the finite ranked as the first, as the real; as the foundation, the abiding foundation, it forms the starting point and the infinite is the reflection-into-self over against it.</p>

But in doing so it is immediately equally a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing,&nbsp;</em>a sublating of the immediate negatively related to it, and this immediate from which it seemed to start as from something alien,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in this its beginning. In this way, the immediate is not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; that means, for us, or in external reflection &mdash; identical with reflection, but this identicalness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>For the immediate is determined by reflection as its negative or its other, but it is reflection itself that negates this determining. Hence the externality of reflection over against the immediate is sublated; its positing in which it negates itself, is the union of itself with its negative, with the immediate, and this union is the immediacy of essence itself. The fact is, therefore, that external reflection is not external, but is no less the immanent reflection of immediacy itself; in other words, the outcome of positing reflection is essence in and for itself. Reflection is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determining reflection.</em></p>

Therefore, what reflection does to the immediate, and the determinations which issue from reflection, are not anything external to the immediate but are its own proper being.</p>

And intellectual reflection, in so far as it operates as external reflection, does in fact start from something immediately given which is alien to it, regarding itself as a merely formal activity which receives its content and material from outside and which, by itself, is only the movement conditioned by that content and material. Further, as will become more evident as soon as we come to consider determining reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the reflected determinations&nbsp;</em>are of a different kind from the merely immediate determinations of being. The latter are more readily granted to be transient, merely relative and standing in relation to other; but the reflected determinations have the form of being-in-and-for-self. This makes them count as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential,&nbsp;</em>and instead of passing over into their opposites they appear rather as absolute, free, and indifferent towards each other. Consequently, they are stubbornly opposed to their movement, their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is their self-identity in their determinateness, in accordance with which, even though they presuppose each other, they maintain themselves completely separate in this relation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/james-clr/works/dialecti/james3.htm#J308" style="color: rgb(51, 0, 80); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong>&copy;</strong></a></p>

This is to be considered in more detail.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;"><span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">1.</span>&nbsp;External reflection starts from immediate being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing</em>&nbsp;reflection from nothing. External reflection, when it determines, posits an other-but this is essence-in the place of the sublated being; but the determination thus posited is not put in the place of an other; the positing has no presupposition. But that is why it is not the completed, determining reflection; the determination that it posits is consequently only something posited; it is an immediate, but not as equal to itself but as negating itself; it has an absolute relation to the return-into-self; it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in reflection-into-self, but it is not this reflection itself.</p>

In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of being, determinate being&nbsp;</em>was the being in which negation was present, and being was the immediate base and element of this negation, which consequently was itself immediate. In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of essence, positedness&nbsp;</em>corresponds to determinate being. It is likewise a determinate being but its base is being as essence or as pure negativity; it is a determinateness or negation, not as affirmatively present [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiend</em>] but immediately as sublated.<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Determinate being is merely posited being or positedness;&nbsp;</em>this is the proposition of essence about determinate being. Positedness stands opposed, on the one hand, to determinate being, and on the other, to essence, and is to be considered as the middle term which unites determinate being with essence, and conversely, essence with determinate being. Accordingly, when it is said that a determination is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>a positedness, this can have a twofold meaning; it is a positedness as opposed to determinate being or as opposed to essence. In the former meaning, determinate being is taken to be superior to positedness and the latter is ascribed to external reflection, to the subjective side. But in fact positedness is the superior; for as positedness, determinate being is that which it is in itself, a negative, something that is simply and solely related to the return-into-self. It is for this reason that positedness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>a positedness with respect to essence, as the negation of the accomplished return-into-self.</p>

The latter is immediate relation to other in general; positedness, too, is a relation to other, but to reflectedness-into-self. Negation as quality, is negation simply as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiend</em>]; being constitutes its ground and element. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, has for this ground reflectedness-into-self. Positedness fixes itself into a determination precisely because reflection is equality-with-self in its negatedness; its negatedness is consequently itself a reflection-into-self. Here the determination persists not through&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>but through its equality with itself. Because being, which supports quality, is not equal to the negation, quality is unequal within itself and hence a transitory moment vanishing in the other. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, is positedness as negation, negation which has negatedness as its ground; it is therefore not unequal within itself, and hence is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential,&nbsp;</em>not transitory determinateness. It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the equality of reflection with itself&nbsp;</em>that possesses the negative only as negative, as sublated or posited being, that enables the negative to persist.</p>

In them the determinateness has established and infinitely fixed itself through the relation-to-self. It is the determinate that has brought into subjection its transitoriness and its mere positedness, or has bent back its reflection-into-other into reflection-into-self. These determinations hereby constitute determinate illusory being as it is in essence, essential illusory being. Because of this,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determining reflection&nbsp;</em>is reflection that has come forth from itself; the equality of essence with itself has perished in the negation, which is the dominant factor.</p>

First, the determination is positedness, negation as such; secondly, it is reflection-into-self. As positedness, it is negation as negation; this accordingly is already its unity with itself. But at first, it is this only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself or in principle&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>], or, it is the immediate as sublating itself in its own self, as the other of itself. To this extent, reflection is an immanent determining. In the process, essence does not go outside itself; the differences are simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited,&nbsp;</em>taken back into essence. But according to the other side, they are not posited but reflected into themselves; the negation as negation is in an equality with itself, is not reflected into its other, into its non-being.</p>

For as positedness, it is negation as such, a non-being over against an other, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">over against&nbsp;</em>absolute reflection-into-self, or over against essence. But as self-relation it is reflected into itself. This its reflection and the above positedness are distinct; its positedness is rather its sublatedness; but its reflectedness-into-self is its subsistence. In so far, therefore, as it is the positedness that is at the same time reflection-into-self, the determinateness of reflection is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the relation to its otherness within itself.</em>It is not an affirmative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiende</em>], quiescent determinateness, which would be related to an other in such a way that the related term and its relation are distinct from each other, the former a being-within-self, a something that excludes its other and its relation to this other from itself; on the contrary, the determination of reflection is in its own self&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the determinate side&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of this determinate side as determinate, that is, to its negation. Quality, through its relation, passes over into an other; in its relation its alteration begins. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, has taken its otherness back into itself. It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness,&nbsp;</em>negation, which however bends back into itself the relation to other, and negation which is equal to itself, the unity of itself and its other, and only through this is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentiality.&nbsp;</em>It is, therefore, positedness, negation; but as reflection-into-self it is at the same time the sublatedness of this positedness, infinite self-relation.</p>

We should then have the propositions, for example: everything is, everything has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being,&nbsp;</em>and so on, or: everything has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality, quantity,</em>&nbsp;etc. For being, determinate being, and so forth, are, simply as logical categories, predicates of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything.&nbsp;</em>According to its etymology and Aristotle&#39;s definition, category is what is predicated or asserted of the existent. But a determinateness of being is essentially a transition into its opposite; the negative of any determinateness is as necessary as the latter itself; as immediate determinatenesses, each is directly confronted by the other. Consequently, if these categories are put in the form of such propositions, then the opposite propositions equally appear; both present themselves with equal necessity and, as immediate assertions, are at least equally correct. The one, therefore, would demand proof as against the other, and consequently these assertions could no longer be credited with the character of immediately true and incontestable propositions of thought.</p>

They are self-related, and so are at the same time determinations removed from determinateness against an other. Further, in that they are determinatenesses which are in themselves<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relations,&nbsp;</em>to that extent they already contain within themselves the prepositional form. For the difference between proposition and judgement is mainly that in the former the content constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>itself or is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific relation.&nbsp;</em>The judgement, on the contrary, transfers the content to the predicate as a universal determinateness which is for itself and is distinct from its relation, the simple copula. When a proposition is to be converted into a judgement, then the specific content &mdash; if, for example it is a verb &mdash; is changed into a participle, in order to separate in this way the determination itself and its relation to a subject. For the determinations of reflection, on the contrary, as positedness reflected into itself, the prepositional form itself lies immediately at hand. Only, since they are enunciated as universal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">laws of thought,&nbsp;</em>they still require a subject of their relation, and this subject is:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything,&nbsp;</em>or an A, which equally means each and every existent.</p>

Further, these propositions are defective in that they have for subject,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being, everything.&nbsp;</em>In this way, they resuscitate being and enunciate the categories of reflection-identity, and so on-of the something as a quality which something has in it, not in the speculative sense, but meaning that something as subject persists in such a quality as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply affirmative&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">als seiendes</em>], not that it has passed over into identity, and so on, as into its truth and its essence.</p>

Such thinking always has before it only abstract identity, and apart from and alongside it, difference. In its opinion, reason is nothing more than a loom on which it externally combines and interweaves the warp, of say, identity, and then the woof of difference; or, also, again proceeding analytically, it now extracts especially identity and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">then also again&nbsp;</em>obtains difference alongside it, is now a positing of likeness and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">then also again&nbsp;</em>a positing of unlikeness &mdash; likeness when&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstraction&nbsp;</em>is made from difference, and unlikeness when abstraction is made from the positing of likeness. These assertions and opinions about what reason does must be completely set aside, since they are in a certain measure merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">historical;&nbsp;</em>the truth is rather that a consideration of everything that is, shows that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>everything is in its self-sameness different from itself and self-contradictory, and that in its difference, in its contradiction, it is self-identical, and is in its own self&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">this movement of transition of one of these categories into the other</span>, and for this reason, that each is in its own self the opposite of itself. The Notion of identity, that it is simple self-related negativity, is not a product of external reflection but has come from being itself. Whereas, on the contrary, that identity that is aloof from difference, and difference that is aloof from identity, are products of external reflection and abstraction, which arbitrarily clings to this point of indifferent difference.</p>

As absolute negation it is the negation that immediately negates itself, a non-being and difference that vanishes in its arising, or a distinguishing by which nothing is distinguished, but which immediately collapses within itself. The distinguishing is the positing of non-being as non-being of the other. But the non-being of the other is sublation of the other and therewith of the distinguishing itself. Here, then, distinguishing is present as self-related negativity, as a non-being which is the non-being of itself, a non-being which has its non-being not in another but in its own self. What is present, therefore, is self-related, reflected difference, or pure,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute difference.</em></p>

Thus it is identity as difference that is identical with itself. But difference is only identical with itself in so far as it is not identity but absolute non-identity. But non-identity is absolute in so far as it contains nothing of its other but only itself, that is, in so far as it is absolute identity with itself.</p>

For it is not pretended that the experiment with the abstract proposition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">A = A&nbsp;</em>has been made on every consciousness. The appeal, then, to actually carried-out experiment is not to be taken seriously; it is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assurance&nbsp;</em>that if the experiment were made, the proposition would be universally admitted. But if what were meant were not the abstract proposition as such, but its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete application&nbsp;</em>from which the former were supposed first to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">developed,&nbsp;</em>then the assertion of its universality and immediacy would consist in the fact that every consciousness would&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">treat it as fundamental,&nbsp;</em>even in every utterance it made, or that it lies&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>in every utterance. But the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application</em>&nbsp;are, in fact, precisely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>of the simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a manifold&nbsp;</em>that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different&nbsp;</em>from it. Expressed as a proposition, the concrete would at first be a synthetic proposition. From the concrete itself or its synthetic proposition, abstraction could indeed extract by analysis the proposition of identity; but then, in fact, it would not have left&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">experience&nbsp;</em>as it is, but<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">altered&nbsp;</em>it; for the fact is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">experience&nbsp;</em>contains identity in unity with difference and is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate refutation&nbsp;</em>of the assertion that abstract identity as such is something true, for the exact opposite, namely, identity only in union with difference, occurs in every experience.</p>

If, for example, to the question &quot;What is a plant?&quot; the answer is given &quot;A plant is a plant&quot;, the truth of such a statement is at once admitted by the entire company on whom it is tested, and at the same time it is equally unanimously declared that the statement says&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing.&nbsp;</em>If anyone opens his mouth and promises to state what God is, namely God is &mdash; God, expectation is cheated, for what was expected was a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different determination;&nbsp;</em>and if this statement is absolute truth, such absolute verbiage is very lightly esteemed; nothing will be held to be more boring and tedious than conversation which merely reiterates the same thing, or than such talk which yet is supposed to be truth.</p>

The prepositional form can be regarded as the hidden necessity of adding to abstract identity the more of that movement. And so an A, or a plant, or some other kind of substrate, too, is added which, as a useless content, is of no significance; but it constitutes the difference which seems to be accidentally associated with it. If instead of A or any other substrate, identity itself is taken &mdash; identity is identity &mdash; then equally it is admitted that also in its place any other substrate could be taken. Consequently, if the appeal is to be made to what experience shows, then it shows that this identity is nothing, that it is negativity, the absolute difference from itself.</p>

But this form is implied in the fact that identity, as the pure movement of reflection, is simple negativity which contains in more developed form the second expression of the law just quoted.

When considered more closely, both identity and difference, as has just been demonstrated, are reflections, each of which is unity of itself and its other; each is the whole. Consequently, the determinateness in which they are only identity or only difference, is sublated. Therefore they are not qualities, because through the reflection-into-self, their determinateness is at the same time only a negation. What is present, therefore, is this duality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection-into-self as</em>&nbsp;such, and determinateness as negation or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness.&nbsp;</em>Positedness is the reflection that is external to itself; it is the negation as negation-and so therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself or simplicity,&nbsp;</em>the self-related negation and reflection-into-self, but only implicitly; it is relation to the negation as something external to it.</p>

For both are determinations of difference; they are relations to one another, the one being what the other is not; like is not unlike and unlike is not like; and both essentially have this relation and have no meaning apart from it; as determinations of difference, each is what it is as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct&nbsp;</em>from its other. But through this mutual indifference, likeness is only self-referred, and unlikeness similarly is self-referred and a reflective determination on its own; each, therefore, is like itself; the difference has vanished, since they cannot have any determinateness over against one another; in other words, each therefore is only likeness.</p>

But, as we have seen, this negative unity is, in fact, the very nature of likeness and unlikeness. The independent self-reference which each of them is, is in fact the self-reference that sublates their distinctiveness and so, too, themselves.</p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit&nbsp;</em>reflection is self-relation without the negation, abstract self-identity, and so simply positedness itself. The merely diverse, therefore, passes over through positedness into negative reflection. The diverse is the merely posited difference, therefore the difference that is no difference, and therefore in its own self the negati on of itself. Thus likeness and unlikeness themselves, that is, positedness, returns through indifference or the implicit reflection back into the negative unity with itself, into the reflection which the difference of likeness and unlikeness in its own self is. Diversity, whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>sides are just as much simply and solely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments&nbsp;</em>of one negative unity, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition.</em></p>

Happy times for metaphysics when it was the occupation of courtiers and the testing of its propositions called for no more exertion than to compare leaves! The reason why this proposition is striking lies in what has been said, that two, or numerical manyness, does not contain any&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>&nbsp;difference and that diversity as such, in its abstraction, is at first indifferent to likeness and unlikeness. Ordinary thinking, even when it goes on to a determination of diversity, takes these moments themselves to be mutually indifferent, so that one without the other, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere likeness&nbsp;</em>of things&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without unlikeness,</em>&nbsp;suffices to determine whether the things are different even when they are only a numerical many, not unlike, but simply different without further qualification. The law of diversity, on the other hand, asserts that things are different from one another through unlikeness, that the determination of unlikeness belongs to them just as much as that of likeness, for determinate difference is constituted only by both together.</p>

This proof would have to exhibit the passage of identity into difference, and then the passage of this into determinate difference, into unlikeness. But as a rule this is not done. We have found that diversity or external difference is, in truth, reflected into itself, is difference in its own self, that the indifferent subsistence of the diverse is a mere positedness and therefore not an external, indifferent difference, but a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single</em>&nbsp;relation of the two moments.</p>

Positedness is likeness and unlikeness; these two reflected into themselves constitute the determinations of opposition. Their reflection-into-self consists in this, that each is in its own self the unity of likeness and unlikeness. Likeness is only in the reflection that compares on the basis of unlikeness, and therefore is mediated by its other, indifferent moment; similarly, unlikeness is only in the same reflective relationship in which likeness is. Therefore each of these moments is, in its determinateness, the whole. It is the whole in so far as it also contains its other moment; but this its other is an indifferent,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple affirmative&nbsp;</em>moment; thus each contains reference to its non-being, and is only reflection-into-self or the whole, as essentially connected with its non-being.</p>

The positive is positedness as reflected into self-likeness; but what is reflected is positedness, that is, the negation as negation, and so this reflection-into-self has reference-to-other for its determination. The negative is positedness as reflected into unlikeness; but the positedness is unlikeness itself, and this reflection is therefore the identity of unlikeness with itself and absolute self-reference. Each is the whole; the positedness reflected into likeness-to-self contains unlikeness, and the positedness reflected into unlikeness-to-self also contains likeness.</p>

On account of their selfsubsistence, they constitute the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>determined opposition. Each is itself and its other; consequently, each has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its determinateness&nbsp;</em>not in an other, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self.&nbsp;</em>Each is self-referred, and the reference to its other is only a self-reference. This has a twofold aspect: each is a reference to its non-being as a sublating of this otherness within it; thus its non-being is only a moment in it. But on the other hand positedness here has become a being, an indifferent subsistence; consequently, the other of itself which each contains is also the non-being of that in which it is supposed to be contained only as a moment. Each therefore is, only in so far as its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being is,&nbsp;</em>and is in an identical relationship with it.</p>

The two sides are thus merely different, and in so far as their being determined as positive and negative constitutes their positedness in relation to one another, each is not in its own self so determined but is only determinateness in general. Therefore, although one of the determinatenesses of positive and negative belongs to each side, they can be changed round, and each side is of such a kind that it can be taken equally well as positive as negative.</p>

It is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not-opposite,&nbsp;</em>the sublated opposition, but as a side of the opposition itself. As positive, something is, of course, determined with reference to an otherness, but in such a manner that its nature is to be not something posited; it is the reflection-into-self that negates the otherness. But the other of itself, the negative, is itself no longer a positedness or moment, but a self-subsistent being; thus the negating reflection of the positive is immanently determined as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">excluding</em>&nbsp;from itself this its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being.</em></p>

We have just found the two real determinations of the positive and negative &mdash; apart from the simple notion of their opposition &mdash; namely, first, that the base is a merely different, immediate existence whose simple reflection-into-self is distinguished from its positedness, from the opposition itself. This opposition, therefore, is not regarded as having any truth in and for itself, and though it does belong to the different sides, so that each is simply an opposite, yet, on the other hand, each side exists indifferently on its own, and it does not matter which of the two opposites is regarded as positive or negative. But secondly, the positive is the positive in and for itself, the negative in and for itself the negative, so that the different sides are not mutually indifferent but this their determination is true in and for itself. These two forms of the positive and negative occur in the very first applications of them in arithmetic.</p>

The opposites are cancelled in their combination. An hour&#39;s journey to the east and the same distance travelled back to the west, cancels the first journey; an amount of liabilities reduces the assets by a similar amount, and an amount of assets reduces the liabilities by the same amount. At the same time, the hour&#39;s journey to the east is not in itself the positive direction, nor is the journey west the negative direction; on the contrary, these directions are indifferent to this determinateness of the opposition; it is a third point of view outside them that makes one positive and the other negative. Thus the liabilities, too, are not in and for themselves the negative; they are the negative only in relation to the debtor; for the creditor, they are his positive asset; they are an amount of money or something of a certain value, and this is a liability or an asset according to an external point of view.</p>

Just as we have pointed out that the sum of money is only one sum, that the a in +a and -a is only one a, and that the distance covered is only one distance, not two, one going east and the other going west. Similarly, an ordinate y is the same on which ever side of the axis it is taken; so far, +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y - y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>; it is only the one ordinate and it has only one determination and law.</p>

Similarly, in economics, a quantum of money or of wealth is not only this one quantum as a means of subsistence but is double: it is a means of subsistence both for the creditor and for the debtor. The wealth of the state is computed not merely as the total of ready money plus the value of property movable and immovable, present in the state; still less is it reckoned as the sum remaining after deduction of liabilities from assets. For capital, even if its respective determinations of assets and liabilities nullified each other, remains first, positive capital, as +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a - a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>; and secondly, since it is a liability in a great number of ways, being lent and re-lent, this makes it a very much multiplied capital.</p>

For example,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>, when it bears no sign, is meant to be taken as positive if it has to be defined. If it were intended to become merely an opposite as such, it could equally well be taken as -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a&nbsp;</em>. But the positive sign is given to it immediately, because the positive on its own has the peculiar meaning of the immediate, as self-identical, in contrast to opposition.</p>

Here the positive must essentially be taken as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not-opposite,</em>&nbsp;and the negative, on the other hand, as the opposite, not both determinations equally as only opposites in general. The textbooks stop short at the notion of opposite magnitudes as such in the proofs of the behaviour of the signs in these two species of calculation; these proofs are therefore incomplete and entangled in contradiction. But in multiplication and division plus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and minus</em>&nbsp;receive the more determinate meaning of the positive and negative in themselves, because the relation of the factors-they are related to one another as unit and amount-is not a mere relation of increasing and decreasing as in the case of addition and subtraction, but is a qualitative relation, with the result that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">minus,&nbsp;</em>too, are endowed with the qualitative meaning of the positive and negative. Without this determination and merely from the notion of opposite magnitudes, the false conclusion can easily be drawn that if -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;= -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, conversely +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>times -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;= +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>. Since one factor is amount and the other unity, and the one which comes first usually means that it takes precedence, the difference between the two expressions -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is that in the former +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is the unit and -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;the amount, and in the latter the reverse is the case. Now in the first case it is usually said that if I am to take +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;-<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times, then I take +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;not merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times but also in the opposite manner, +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>; therefore since it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus,&nbsp;</em>I have to take it negatively, and the product is -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>. But if, in the second case, -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is to be taken +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times, then -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;likewise is not to be taken -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times but in the opposite determination, namely +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times. Therefore it follows from the reasoning in the first case, that the product must be +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>. And similarly in the case of division.</p>

In point of fact, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>does not possess this power, for it is to be taken here as qualitatively determined against the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">minus,&nbsp;</em>the factors having a qualitative relationship to one another. Consequently, the negative here is the intrinsically opposite as such, but the positive is an indeterminate, indifferent sign in general; it is, of course, also the negative, but the negative of the other, not in its own self the negative. A determination as negation, therefore, is introduced solely by the negative, not by the positive.</p>

If this negative is only taken as identical with the first, then it, too, like the first, is merely immediate; and so they are not taken as mutual opposites and therefore not as negatives; the negative is not an immediate at all. But now, since it is also just as much a fact that each is the same as its opposite, this relation of the unlike is just as much their identical relation.</p>

It is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;self-subsistence and is the sublating of this positedness, and it is only through this sublating that it becomes explicitly and in fact a self-subsistent unity. True, through the sublating of otherness or positedness, we are again presented with positedness, the negative of an other. But in point of fact, this negation is not merely the first, immediate relation-to-other again, not positedness as a sublated immediacy, but as a sublated positedness. The excluding reflection of self-subsistence, being exclusive, converts itself into a positedness, but is just as much a sublating of its positedness. It is a sublating self-relation; in this, it first sublates the negative, and secondly, posits itself as a negative, and it is only this negative that it sublates; in sublating the negative, it posits and sublates itself at the same time. In this way, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive determination itself&nbsp;</em>is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>of itself whose negation it is; consequently, the sublating of this positedness is not again a positedness as the negative of an other, but is a uniting with itself, the positive unity with itself. Self-subsistence is thus through&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>own negation a unity returned into itself, since it returns into itself through the negation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own&nbsp;</em>positedness.

Therefore essence as ground is the excluding reflection in such wise that it makes its own self into a positedness, that the opposition from which we started and which was the immediate, is the merely posited, determinate self-subsistence of essence, and that opposition is merely that which sublates itself within itself, whereas essence is that which, in its determinateness, is reflected into itself.

In opposition, the determination has attained to self-subsistence; but ground is this completed self-subsistence; in it, the negative is self-subsistent essence, but as a negative; as self-identical in this negativity, ground is just as much the positive. Opposition and its contradiction is, therefore, in ground as much abolished as preserved. Ground is essence as positive identity-with-self, which, however, at the same time relates itself to itself as negativity, and therefore determines itself and converts itself into an excluded positedness; but this positedness is the whole self-subsistent essence, and essence is ground, as self-identical and positive in this its negation. The self-contradictory, self-subsistent opposition was therefore already itself ground; all that was added to it was the determination of unity-with-self, which results from the fact that each of the self-subsistent opposites sublates itself and makes itself into its opposite, thus falling to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">zugrunde geht</em>]; but in this process it at the same time only unites with itself; therefore, it is only in falling to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in seinem Untergange</em>], that is, in its positedness or negation, that the opposite is really the essence that is reflected into and identical with itself.</p>

Indeed, if the negative expresses nothing else but the abstraction of a subjective caprice or a determination of an external comparison, than of course it does not exist for the objective positive, that is, this is not related in its own self to such empty abstraction;</span>&nbsp;that case the determination that it is a positive is likewise merely external to it. Thus, to take an example of the fixed opposition of these reflective determinations, light as such is reckoned as the pure positive and darkness as the pure negative. But light essentially possesses in its infinite expansion and in its power to promote growth and to animate, the nature of absolute negativity. Darkness, on the other hand, as a non-manifold or as the non-self-differentiating womb of generation, is the simply self-identical, the positive. It is taken as the pure negative in the sense that, as the mere absence of light, it simply does not exist for it, so that light, in its relation with darkness, is supposed to be in relation, not with an other but purely with itself, darkness therefore simply vanishing before it. But it is a familiar fact that light is dimmed to grey by darkness; and besides this merely quantitative alteration it suffers also the qualitative change of being determined to colour by its relation to darkness. Thus, for example virtue too is not without conflict; rather is it the supreme, finished conflict; as such it is not merely the positive, but is absolute negativity; also it is virtue not only in comparison with vice, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>opposition and conflict. Or again,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice&nbsp;</em>is not merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lack&nbsp;</em>of virtue-innocence, too, is this lack-nor is it distinct from virtue only for an external reflection; on the contrary, it is in its own self opposed to it, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">evil.&nbsp;</em>Evil consists in being self-poised in opposition to the good; it is a positive negativity. But innocence, being neither good nor evil, is indifferent to both determinations, is neither positive nor negative. But at the same time this lack must also be taken as a determinateness: on the one hand, it is to be considered as the positive nature of something; on the other, it is related to an opposite, and every nature emerging from its innocency, from its indifferent self-identity, spontaneously relates itself to its other and thereby falls to the ground or, in the positive sense, withdraws into its ground.</p>

Further, it is not to be taken merely as an abnormality which occurs only here and there, but is rather the negative as determined in the sphere of essence, the principle of all self-movement, which consists solely in an exhibition of it. External, sensuous movement itself is contradiction&#39;s immediate existence. Something moves, not because at one moment it is here and at another there, but because at one and the same moment it is here and not here, because in this &#39;here&#39;, it at once is and is not.

We remarked that this sum total thus becomes simple indeterminate being, or if the realities are, in fact, taken as a plurality of determinate beings, into the sum-total of all negations. More precisely, when the difference of reality is taken into account, it develops from difference into opposition, and from this into contradiction, so that in the end the sum total of all realities simply becomes absolute contradiction within itself. Ordinary &mdash; but not speculative &mdash; thinking, which abhors contradiction, as nature abhors a vacuum, rejects this conclusion; for in considering contradiction, it stops short at the one-sided&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">resolution&nbsp;</em>of it into<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>and fails to recognise the positive side of contradiction where it becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute activity&nbsp;</em>and absolute ground.</p>

In an ordinary inference the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>&nbsp;of the finite appears as the Ground of the absolute: because the finite is the inherently self-contradictory opposition, because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>.

Essence is only this its negativity, which is pure reflection. It is this pure negativity as the return of being into itself; as such, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined in itself,&nbsp;</em>or for us, as ground in which being is dissolved. But this determinateness is not posited&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by essence itself;&nbsp;</em>in other words, essence is not ground except in so far as it has itself posited this its determinateness. Its reflection, however, consists in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing and determining</em>&nbsp;itself as that which it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself,&nbsp;</em>as a negative. The positive and negative constitute that determination of essence in which essence is lost in its negation. These self-subsistent determinations of reflection sublate themselves, and the determination that has fallen to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">zugrunde gegangene</em>] is the true determination of essence.</p>

The reflected determination, in falling to the ground, acquires its true meaning, namely, to be within itself the absolute recoil upon itself, that is to say, the positedness that belongs to essence is only a sublated positedness, and conversely, only self-sublating positedness is the positedness of essence. Essence, in determining itself as ground, is determined as the non-determined; its determining is only the sublating of its being determined. Essence, in being determined thus as self-sublating, has not proceeded from another, but is, in its negativity, self-identical essence.</p>

Thus essence, in determining itself as ground, proceeds only from itself. As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,</em>therefore, it posits itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as essence,&nbsp;</em>and it is in positing itself as essence that its determining consists.

To add that the ground must be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficient</em>&nbsp;is really quite superfluous for it is self-evident; that for which the ground is not sufficient would not have a ground, but everything is supposed to have a ground. Leibnitz, however, who had the principle of the sufficient ground very much at heart and even made it the basis of his entire philosophy, associated with it a profounder meaning and more important concept than is usually connected with it when no advance is made beyond the immediate expression; although even with this meaning, the law must be considered important, for it declares being as such in its immediacy to be untrue and essentially something posited, and ground is declared to be the true immediate. But&nbsp;<a name="HL2_446b"></a>Leibnitz opposed the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficiency</em>&nbsp;of ground mainly to causality in its strict sense as mechanical mode of action. Since this is an altogether external activity, restricted as regards content to a single determinateness, the determinations are comprehended by their causes, but their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection</em>, which constitutes the essential feature of an existent, is not contained in causes belonging to the sphere of mechanism. This relationship in which the&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">whole is an essential unity</span>, lies only in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>, in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end</em>. Mechanical causes are not sufficient for this unity because their basis is not end as the unity of the determinations.

This mediation of the ground is therefore the unity of the pure and the determining reflection; their determinations or the posited, has a subsistence, and conversely, their subsistence is a posited. Because this their subsistence is itself a posited or has a determinateness, they are distinguished from their simple identity, and constitute the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form as against essence.</em></p>

It is only as ground that it has a fixed immediacy or is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Substrat</em>]. Essence as such is one with its reflection and inseparable from the movement of reflection itself. Consequently, it is not essence through which the reflective movement runs; nor is essence a first from which reflection begins. This circumstance makes the exposition of reflection in general more difficult; for we cannot really say that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence&nbsp;</em>withdraws into itself, that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence&nbsp;</em>inwardly reflects itself, because it is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">before or&nbsp;</em>in its movement, and this has no substrate on which it runs its course. A related determination only makes its appearance in ground conformably to the moment of sublated reflection. But essence as related substrate is determinate essence; by virtue of this positedness it essentially contains form. The form determinations, on the other hand, are now determinations&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as in essence; the latter lies at their base&nbsp;</em>as the indeterminate which, in its determination, is indifferent towards them; in it they have their reflection-into-self. The determinations of reflection ought to have their subsistence within themselves and to be self-subsistent; but their self-subsistence is their dissolution; they have it in an other; but this dissolution is itself this self-identity or the ground of their subsistence that they give to themselves.</p>

Further, the form-determinations of essence, as determinatenesses of reflection, are, in their more precise determinateness, the moments of reflection considered above,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity and difference,&nbsp;</em>the latter partly as diversity, partly as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition.&nbsp;</em>But, again, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground relation&nbsp;</em>also belongs to form since, although it is the sublated determination of reflection, essence is thereby made into something posited. On the other hand, the identity possessed by ground does not belong to form, for in this, positedness as sublated and positedness as such &mdash; ground and the grounded &mdash; is a single reflection that constitutes essence as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple substrate&nbsp;</em>which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsisting&nbsp;</em>of form. But this subsistence is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in ground; or this essence is essentially determinate and is thus once again the moment of ground-relation and form. This is the absolute reciprocal relation of form and essence, that essence is this simple unity of ground and grounded, but in this very unity is itself determined, or a negative, and distinguishes itself as substrate from form, but thus at the same time itself becomes ground and moment of form.</p>

External reflection usually does not go beyond this distinction of essence and form; the distinction is necessary, but this distinguishing is itself their unity, just as this basic unity is essence which repels itself from itself and makes itself into a positedness. Form is absolute negativity or negative absolute self-identity through which precisely essence is not being but essence. This identity, taken abstractly, is essence as against form; just as negativity, taken abstractly, as positedness, is the single determination of form. But the determination, as we have seen, is, in its truth, the total, self-related negativity which, therefore, as this identity is in its own self simple essence. Consequently, form has in its own identity essence, just as essence has in its negative nature absolute form.</p>

To say that form determines essence means, therefore, that form in its distinguishing sublates this very distinguishing and is the self-identity which essence is as the subsistence of the determination; it is the contradiction of being sublated in its positedness and of persisting in this sublatedness; it is accordingly ground as the essence that, in being determined or negated, is identical with itself.</p>

But the two are not on that account simply present as externally and contingently opposite to one another; neither matter nor form is self-originated, or, in another terminology, eternal Matter is that which is indifferent to form, but this indifference is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of self-identity into which form withdraws as into its basis. Form<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes&nbsp;</em>matter in the very fact that it posits itself as sublated and consequently relates itself to this its identity as to an other. Conversely, form is presupposed by matter; for the latter is not simple essence, which is immediately itself absolute reflection, but it is essence determined as the positive, that is, essence that only is as sublated negation. But from the other side, because form posits itself as matter only in so far as it sublates, hence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes,&nbsp;</em>matter, matter is also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a groundless&nbsp;</em>subsistence. Equally matter is not determined as the ground of form; but since matter posits itself as the abstract identity of the sublated form determination, it is not identity as ground, and, in so far, form is groundless relatively to it. Form and matter alike are accordingly determined as being not posited by one another, as not being the ground of one another. Matter is rather the identity of the ground and the grounded, as a basis which stands over against this form relation. This their common determination of indifference is the determination of matter as such and constitutes, too, the mutual connection of both. Similarly, the determination of form to be the relation of the two as distinct sides, is also the other moment of their mutual relationship. Matter, the indifferently determinate, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passive&nbsp;</em>side over against form as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">active</em>side. The latter, as the self-related negative is the internal contradiction: it is self-resolving, self-repelling and self-determining. It relates itself to matter and is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as relating itself to this its subsistence as to an other. Matter, on the other hand, is posited as being related only to itself and as indifferent to other; but it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>related to form; for it contains sublated negativity and is matter only through this determination. It is related to form as to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>only because form is not posited in it, because it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>form. Matter contains form locked up within it and is absolute susceptibility to form only because it has form absolutely within itself, only because form is its implicit determination.&nbsp;<a name="HL2_452"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Matter must therefore be formed</em>, and form must therefore materialise itself</span>, must give itself in matter self-identity or subsistence.</p>

Since it is itself two-sided, this sublating, too, has a double aspect: first, it sublates&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its self-subsistence,</em>&nbsp;converts itself into something posited, into something that is in an other, and this its other is matter. Secondly, it sublates its determinateness relatively to matter, its relation to it, and consequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its positedness,&nbsp;</em>and in doing so gives itself a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence.&nbsp;</em>Since form sublates its positedness, this its reflection is its own identity into which it passes; but since, at the same time, it divests itself of this identity and opposes itself to itself as matter, this reflection of the positedness into itself is a union with a matter in which it obtains a subsistence; in this union, therefore, it is just as much united with matter&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as an other</em>&nbsp;&mdash; in accordance with the first aspect whereby it converts itself into something posited-as also, in that other, it is united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with its own identity.</em></p>

But, conversely, in doing so, form also bears itself negatively towards matter; yet this activity by which matter is determined is just as much a movement belonging to form itself. Form is free from matter, but it sublates this its self-subsistence; but its self-subsistence is matter itself, for in this it has its essential identity. Therefore the conversion of itself into something posited is the same thing as its making matter into something determinate. But looked at from the other side, form is at the same time divested of its own identity, and matter is its other; and to this extent, matter is also not determined, since form sublates its own self-subsistence. But matter is self-subsistent only as against form; the negative, in sublating itself, also sublates the positive. Form, therefore, having sublated itself, the determinateness which matter has as against form also disappears, namely, to be an indeterminate subsistence.</p>

Through this, matter is not related to form simply as to an other: on the contrary, this external other is the form that lies concealed within matter itself. Matter is the same internal contradiction that form contains, and this contradiction, like its resolution, is only one. But matter is internally contradictory because, as indeterminate self-identity, it is also absolute negativity; it therefore sublates itself internally and its identity disintegrates in its negativity and the latter obtains from the former its subsistence. Therefore matter, in being determined by form as by something external, thereby achieves its determination, and the externality of the relationship both for form and matter consists in the fact that each, or rather their original unity, in its positing is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing,</em>&nbsp;with the result that the relation to itself is at the same time a relation to itself as sublated, or a relation to its other.</p>

Matter is just as much self-determined, as this determining is for it an external activity of the form; conversely, form determines only itself or has within itself the matter that is determined by it, just as much as in its determining it relates itself to an other;&nbsp;<a name="HL2_454"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">and both, the activity of form and the movement of matter, are the same</span>, save that the former is an activity, that is, negativity as posited, whereas the latter is a movement or becoming, negativity as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;determination.

It is not ground but only the active principle. Similarly, matter, in so far as it presupposes form as its non-being, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite&nbsp;</em>matter; just as little is it ground of its unity with form, but only the basis for form. But this finite matter as well as the finite form has no truth; each relates itself to the other, in other words, only their unity is their truth. Into this unity both these determinations withdraw and therein sublate their self-subsistence: this unity thus demonstrates itself to be their ground. Matter is therefore ground of its form-determination only in so far as it is not matter as matter, but the absolute unity of essence and form; similarly, form is ground of the subsistence of its determinations only in so far as it is the same one unity. But this one unity as absolute negativity, and more specifically, as exclusive unity is, in its reflection, presupposing; or, there is but a single activity: form in its positing both preserves itself, as posited, in the unity, and also repels itself from itself; it is related to itself as itself and also to itself as an other. Or, the process by which matter is determined by form is the mediation of essence as ground with itself in a unity, through its own self and through the negation of itself.</p>

But then this negative element is the negative relation of the form to itself. On the one hand, what has been posited sublates itself and withdraws into its ground; but the ground, the essential self-subsistence, relates itself negatively to itself and makes itself into a positedness. This negative mediation of the ground and the grounded is the characteristic mediation of the form as such,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal mediation.&nbsp;</em>Now both sides of the form, because each passes over into the other, mutually posit themselves as sublated in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one identity; in</em>&nbsp;doing so they at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppose&nbsp;</em>this identity. It is the determinate content to which, therefore, the formal mediation is related through itself as to the positive mediating principle. This content is the identical element of both, and since they are distinguished, but each in its difference is relation to the other, it is their subsistence, the subsistence of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">each&nbsp;</em>as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

Secondly, the ground itself is just as much a moment of the form as that which is posited by it; this is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity in respect of the form.&nbsp;</em>It does not matter which of the two determinations is made the first, whether the transition is made from the posited to the other as ground, or from the one as ground to the other as the posited. The grounded considered on its own is the sublating of itself; through this it makes itself on the one hand into a posited, and is at the same time a positing of the ground. The same movement is the ground as such, it makes itself into a posited and thereby becomes the ground of something, that is, in this movement it is present both as a posited and also first as ground. The posited is the ground that there is a ground, and conversely the ground is therefore a posited. The mediation begins just as much from the one as from the other, each side is just as much ground as posited, and each is the whole mediation or the whole form. Furthermore the whole form itself is, as the self-identical, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate&nbsp;</em>of the determinations which are the two sides of the ground and the grounded, and thus form and content are themselves one and the same identity.</p>

If one asks what kind of a force the attractive force is, the answer is that it is the force that makes the earth move round the sun; that is, it has precisely the same content as the phenomenon of which it is supposed to be the ground;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_145" style="color: rgb(51, 0, 80); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong>&reg;</strong></a>&nbsp;the relation of the earth and sun in respect of motion is the identical substrate of the ground and the grounded. When a crystalline form is explained by saying that it has its ground in the particular arrangement which the molecules form with one another, the fact is that the existent crystalline form is this very arrangement that is adduced as ground. In ordinary life, these aetiologies, which are the prerogative of the sciences, count for what they are, tautological empty talk.</p>

Leibniz objected to the Newtonian force of attraction that it was the same kind of occult quality that the scholastics used for the purpose of explanation. Rather is it the opposite objection which must be made to it, namely, that it is a too familiar quality; for it has no other content than the phenomenon itself. What commends this mode of explanation is precisely its great clarity and intelligibility; for there is nothing clearer or more intelligible than that, for example, a plant has its ground in a vegetative, that is, plant-producing force. It could be called an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occult&nbsp;</em>quality only in the sense that the ground is supposed to have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another content&nbsp;</em>than the thing to be explained, and such a ground is not adduced; the force used for the purpose of explanation is of course a concealed or occult ground in so far as the kind of ground demanded is not adduced. Something is no more explained by this formalism than the nature of a plant is known when I say that it is a plant; or that it has its ground in a plant-producing force; this statement with all its clarity can therefore be called a very<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occult&nbsp;</em>mode of explanation.</p>

The ground is, on the one hand, ground as the reflection-into-self of the determination of the content of the phenomenon which it grounds, on the other hand, it is the posited. It is that from which the phenomenon is to be understood; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conversely,&nbsp;</em>it is the ground that is inferred from the phenomenon and the former is understood from the latter. The main business of this reflection consists, namely, in finding the grounds from the phenomenon, that is, converting the immediate phenomenon into the form of reflected being; consequently the ground, instead of being in and for itself and self-subsistent, is, on the contrary, the posited and derived. Now since in this procedure the ground is derived from the phenomenon and its determinations are based on it, the phenomenon certainly flows quite smoothly and with a favourable wind from its ground. But in this way, knowledge has not advanced a step; its movement is confined within a difference of form which this same procedure inverts and sublates.</p>

The exposition begins with grounds which are placed in mid-air as principles and primary concepts; they are simple determinations devoid of any necessity in and for themselves; what follows is supposed to be based on them. Therefore he who aims to penetrate such sciences must begin by instilling his mind with these grounds, a distasteful business for reason because it is asked to treat what is groundless as a valid foundation. Success comes most easily when, without much reflection, the principles are simply accepted as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given&nbsp;</em>and one then proceeds to use them as fundamental rules of one&#39;s understanding. Without this method one cannot make a start; nor without it can any progress be made. But progress is hindered by the fact that it reveals how the method counteracts itself: it proposes to demonstrate in the consequent what is derived, but in fact it is only in the derived that the grounds of the above presuppositions are contained. Also because the consequent shows itself to be the phenomenon from which the ground was derived, this relation in which the phenomenon is presented awakens a distrust of the exposition of it; for the relation presents itself not as expressed in its immediacy but as a support for the ground. But because this again is derived from the phenomenon one demands rather to see it in its immediacy in order to be able to derive the ground from it. In such an exposition, therefore, one does not know how to take either ground or phenomenon. Uncertainty is increased, especially if the exposition is not rigorously consistent but is more&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">honest,&nbsp;</em>by the fact that one comes across traces and features of the phenomenon which point to more and different things than are contained in the principles alone. Lastly, confusion becomes still greater when reflected and merely hypothetical determinations are mingled with immediate determinations of the phenomenon itself, and the former are spoken of as though they belonged to immediate experience. Many who come to these sciences with an honest belief may well imagine that molecules, empty interstices, centrifugal force, the ether, the single, separate ray of light, electrical and magnetic matter, and a host of other such things which are spoken of as though they had an immediate existence, are things or relations actually present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in perception.&nbsp;</em>They serve as primary grounds for something else, are enunciated as actualities and confidently applied; one lets them count as such in good faith before coming aware that they are, on the contrary, determinations inferred from that of which they are supposed to be the grounds, hypotheses and fictions derived from an uncritical reflection. In fact, one finds oneself in a kind of witches&#39; circle in which determinations of real being and determinations of reflection, ground and grounded, phenomena and phantoms, run riot in indiscriminate company and enjoy equal rank with one another.</p>

Or, considered from the side of the content, because this is the identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the ground-relation&nbsp;</em>with itself, it essentially possesses this difference of the form within itself, and then is, as ground, other than what it is as grounded.</p>

Therefore when we ask for a ground, we really demand that the content of the ground be a different determination from that of the phenomenon whose ground we are seeking.</p>

Namely, in so far as the two sides have a different content, they are indifferent to one another; each is an immediate, self-identical determination. Further, in their relationship as ground and grounded, the ground, in being reflected into the other as into its positedness, is reflected into itself; the content, therefore, possessed by the side of the ground, is equally in the grounded; the latter, as the posited, has its self-identity and subsistence only in the ground. But apart from this content of the ground, the grounded now also has its own distinctive content and is accordingly the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">twofold</em>&nbsp;content. Now this, as the unity of distinct sides, is indeed their negative unity, but because the determinations of the content are mutually indifferent, the unity is only their empty, intrinsically contentless relation, not their mediation; a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>as an external combination of them.</p>

Therefore, what more is added in the grounded to this simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence,&nbsp;</em>is only an unessential form, external determinations of the content which, as such, are free from the ground and are an immediate manifoldness. Of this unessential side, therefore, the essential is not the ground, nor is it ground of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of both to one another in the grounded. It is a positively identical that indwells the grounded, but does not posit itself therein in any difference of form, but, as self-related content, is an indifferent positive&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, what is combined with this substrate in the something is an indifferent content, but as the unessential side. The main thing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the substrate and the unessential manifoldness. But because the related determinations are an indifferent content, this relation is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not ground;&nbsp;</em>true, one of them is determined as essential and the other as unessential or posited content, but as self-related content this form is external to both. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one of the something&nbsp;</em>that constitutes their relation is therefore not a form relation but only an external bond which does not contain the unessential manifold content as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited;&nbsp;</em>it is therefore likewise only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate.</em></p>

The two relations, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential content&nbsp;</em>as the simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate identity&nbsp;</em>of the ground and grounded, and then the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>as relation of the diversified content, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two different substrates;&nbsp;</em>the self-identical form of the ground, namely, that the something is, on the one hand, essential and, on the other hand, posited, has vanished; the ground relation has thus become<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to itself.</p>

Real ground contains a diversified content; but this brings with it the contingency and externality of the ground relation. On the one hand, that which is considered as the essential and therefore as the fundamental determination, is not the ground of the other determinations connected with it. On the other hand, it is also undetermined which of the several determinations of the content of a concrete thing ought to be taken as essential and as ground; hence the choice between them is free. Thus in the former respect, for example, the ground of a house is its foundation; this is the ground by virtue of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gravity&nbsp;</em>which is inherent in sensuous matter and which is the purely identical principle in both ground and the house which is grounded. Now that there is in heavy matter such a distinction as that of a foundation and a modification distinct from it through which it constitutes a house, this fact is a matter of complete indifference to the heavy matter itself; its relation to other determinations of the content, of the end, of the furnishing of the house, and so on, is external to it; consequently, though it is indeed the foundation, it is not the ground of these determinations. Gravity, which is the ground for a house standing, is no less also the ground for a stone falling; the stone has this ground, gravity, within it; but that the stone has a further determination of its content by virtue of which it is not merely something heavy but a stone, this is external to gravity; further, it is something else that has caused the stone to be placed beforehand at a distance from the body upon which it falls; similarly time, space, and their relation, which is motion, are another content than gravity and can be conceived of without it (as the saying is), and consequently are not essentially posited by it. Gravity is also equally the ground which makes a projectile describe a trajectory opposite to that of a falling body. From the variety of determinations of which it is the ground, it is clear that something else is also required to make it the ground of this or some other determination.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_146" style="color: rgb(51, 0, 80); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong>&reg;</strong></a></p>

In the latter, the self-identical content is indifferent to the form; in real ground this is equally true. Now the result of this is, further, that the real ground does not itself indicate which of the manifold determinations ought to be taken as essential.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Something&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>of manifold determinations which show themselves to be equally fixed and permanent in it. One as much as another can therefore be determined as ground, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as essential,&nbsp;</em>compared with which the other is then only a posited. This links up with what has already been mentioned, namely, from the fact that in one case a determination is present as ground of another, it does not follow that this other is posited with it in another case or at all. Punishment, for example, has various determinations: it is retribution, a deterrent example as well, a threat used by the law as a deterrent, and also it brings the criminal to his senses and reforms him. Each of these different determinations has been considered the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground of punishment,&nbsp;</em>because each is an essential determination, and therefore the others, as distinct from it, are determined as merely contingent relatively to it. But the one which is taken as ground is still not the whole punishment itself; this concrete also contains those others which, whilst associated with the ground in the punishment, do not have their ground in the latter. Again, an official has an aptitude for his office, as an individual has relationships with others, has a circle of acquaintances, a particular character, made an appearance in such and such circumstances and on such and such occasions, and so on. Each of these attributes can be, or can be regarded as, the ground for his holding his office; they are a diverse content which is joined together in a third; the form, in which they are determined as being either essential or posited in relation to one another, is external to the content. Each of these attributes is essential to the official because through it he is the specific individual that he is; in so far as the office can be regarded as an external, posited determination, each can be determined as ground relatively to it, but also conversely, they can be regarded as posited and the office as their ground. How they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually&nbsp;</em>related, that is, in the individual case, this is a determination external to the ground relation and to the content itself; it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third&nbsp;</em>that imparts to them the form of ground and grounded.</p>

Therefore whether a ground has this or that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequent&nbsp;</em>is equally contingent. Moral motives, for example, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential determinations&nbsp;</em>of the ethical nature, but what follows from them is at the same time an externality distinct from them, which follows and also does not follow from them; it is only through a third that it is attached to them. More accurately this is to be understood in this way, that if the moral motive is a ground, it is not contingent to it whether it has or has not a consequent or a grounded, but it is contingent whether it is or is not made a ground at all. But again, since the content which is the consequent of the moral motive, if this has been made the ground, has the nature of externality, it can be immediately sublated by another externality. Therefore an action may, or may not, issue from a moral motive. Conversely, an action can have various grounds; as a concrete, it contains manifold essential determinations, each of which can therefore be assigned as ground. The search for and assignment of grounds, in which argumentation mainly consists, is accordingly an endless pursuit which does not reach a final determination; for any and every thing one or more good grounds can be given, and also for its opposite; and a host of grounds can exist without anything following from them. What Socrates and Plato call&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sophistry is</em>&nbsp;nothing else but argumentation from grounds; to this, Plato opposes the contemplation of the Idea, that is, of the subject matter in and for itself or in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion.&nbsp;</em>Grounds are taken only from<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>determinations of a content,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>relationships and aspects, and of these every subject matter, just like its opposite, possesses several; in their form of essentiality, one is as valid as another; because it does not embrace the whole extent of the subject matter, each is a one-sided ground, the other particular sides having on their part particular grounds, and none of them exhausts the subject matter which constitutes their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">togetherness&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Verkn&uuml;pfung</em>] and contains them all; none is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficient&nbsp;</em>ground, that is, the Notion.</p>

But each is an indifferent content, so that the one determination is not in its own self ground, nor is the other in its own self that which is grounded by the first; the fact is, that in the immediacy of the content, this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>is a sublated or posited relation and has, as such, its ground in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another.&nbsp;</em>This second relation, as different only in respect of form, has the same content as the first, namely, the two determinations of the content, but it is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;&#39;togetherness&#39;. However, the determinations thus connected constitute a simply varied content, and are therefore determined as indifferent to one another; consequently, this relation is not their truly absolute relation in which one of the determinations would be self-identical in positedness, and the other only this positedness of the same self-identical determination.</p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two somethings&nbsp;</em>are therefore the two distinct relations of the content which have been brought to view. They stand in the identical ground-relation of form; they are one and the same<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole content,&nbsp;</em>namely, the two determinations of the content and their relation; they are distinguished only by the kind of this relation, which in the one is an immediate, in the other a posited relation; through this, they are distinguished one from the other as ground and grounded only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in respect of form.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, this ground-relation is not merely formal, but also real. The formal ground passes over into real ground as we have seen; the moments of form are reflected into themselves; they are a self-subsistent content, and the ground relation also contains one peculiar&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content as ground,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another as grounded.&nbsp;</em>The content, in the first instance, constitutes the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>identity of the two sides of the formal ground which thus have one and the same content. But it also has form within it and is thus a twofold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>which has the nature of ground and grounded. One of the two determinations of the two somethings is therefore determined as being, not merely common to them as in an external comparison, but as being their identical substrate and the foundation of their relation. As against the other determination of the content, this determination is essential and is the ground of the other which is posited, namely, in the something, of which the grounded determination is the relation. In the first something, which is the ground-relation, this second determination of the content is immediately and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>connected with the first. But the other something only contains the one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;as that in which it is immediately identical with the first something, but the other as the determination posited in it. The former determination of the content is its ground by virtue of its being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">originally&nbsp;</em>connected with the other determination in. the first something.</p>

The inference is as follows: in one something, the determination B is implicitly connected with determination A; therefore, in the second something to which only the one determination A immediately belongs, B is also linked with A. In the second something, not only is this second determination a mediated one, but the fact that its immediate determination is ground is also mediated, namely, by its original connection with B in the first something. This connection is thus the ground of ground A, and the whole ground-relation is, in the second something, a posited or a grounded.</p>

The ground-relation, being essential form, its sides are determined as sublated or as moments. Therefore, as form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>determinations, it is self-identical relation at the same time that it is the relation of its negation; hence it is ground, not in and for itself, but as relation to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the sublated</em>ground-relation. Secondly, the sublated relation or the immediate which, in the original and the posited relation, is the identical<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrata,&nbsp;</em>is likewise not in and for itself real ground; on the contrary, it is posited as being ground through that original connection.</p>

According to that relation it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited;&nbsp;</em>the immediate something ought to be, as condition, not for itself but for something else. But at the same time, the fact that it is thus for another, is itself only a positedness; this fact that it is a posited is sublated in its immediacy, and a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something is indifferent to its being a condition.&nbsp;</em>Thirdly, condition is an immediate in such a manner that it constitutes the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition&nbsp;</em>of the ground. In this determination it is the form relation of the ground, withdrawn into identity with itself, and is consequently the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of the ground. But the content as such is only the indifferent unity of the ground, as in form - without form there is no content. Further, it frees itself from this indifferent unity in that, in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete&nbsp;</em>ground, the ground relation becomes a relation external to its identity, whereby the content acquires immediacy. In so far, therefore, as condition is that in which the ground-relation has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-identity,&nbsp;</em>it constitutes the content of the ground; but because the content is indifferent to this form, it is only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>its content, something which has yet to become content and hence constitutes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">material&nbsp;</em>for the ground. Posited as condition, something has the determination (in accordance with the second moment) of losing its indifferent immediacy and becoming moment of something else. Through its immediacy it is indifferent to this relation; but, in so far as it enters into this relation, it constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>of the ground and is for the latter the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned.&nbsp;</em>In order to be condition, it has in the ground its presupposition and is itself conditioned; but this determination is external to it.</p>

Condition is the moment of unconditioned immediacy for the ground, but is not itself the movement and the positing that is negatively self-related and that makes itself into positedness. The ground-relation, therefore, stands over against condition. Something has, apart from its condition, also a ground. This is the empty movement of reflection, because reflection has the immediacy that is its presupposition, outside it. But it is the whole form and the self-subsistent mediating process; for the condition is not its ground. Since this mediating process is, as a positing, self-related, it is from this side also an immediate and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned;&nbsp;</em>true, it presupposes itself, but as a discarded or sublated positing; on the other hand, what it is according to its determination, that it is in and for itself. In so far as the ground relation is a self-subsistent relation-to-self, and it has within it the identity of reflection, it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own peculiar content&nbsp;</em>over against the content of the condition. The former is content of the ground and therefore essentially formed; the latter, on the other hand, is only an immediate material, whose relation to the ground is external to it while, at the same time, it no less constitutes the in-itself of the ground. It is thus a mixture of the self-subsistent content which has no relation to the content of the ground-determination, and of such content that enters into the ground-determination and, as its material, is meant to become a moment of it.</p>

But further, the two sides are also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated.&nbsp;</em>Condition is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>of the ground; so much is it an essential moment of the ground-relation, that it is the simple self-identity of the ground. But this, too, is sublated; this in-itself is only a positedness; the immediate determinate being is indifferent to the fact that it is condition. The fact, therefore, that the condition is an in-itself for the ground constitutes that side of it which makes it mediated. Similarly, the ground-relation, in its self-subsistence, also has a presupposition, and has its in-itself outside it. Thus each of the two sides is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradiction&nbsp;</em>of indifferent immediacy and essential mediation, both in a single relation-or the contradiction of self subsistent existence and the determination of being only a moment.</p>

Both sides of the form are external to the immediate determinate being; for this is the sublated ground relation. But, first, determinate being is in its own self only this, to sublate itself in its immediacy and to fall to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">zugrunde zu gehen</em>]<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">. Being&nbsp;</em>is simply only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em>&nbsp;of essence; it is its essential nature to make itself into a positedness and into an identity which, through negation of itself, is the immediate. The form-determinations, therefore, of positedness and of the self-identical in-itself, the form through which the immediate determinate being is condition, are therefore not external to it; on the contrary, it is this reflection itself. Secondly, as condition, being is now also posited as that which it essentially is, namely, as moment, hence as moment of an other, and at the same time, as an in-itself, likewise of an other; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>being only is through the negation of itself, namely, through ground and through ground&#39;s self-sublating, and therefore presupposing, reflection; the in-itself of being is accordingly only a posited. This in-itself of condition has two sides: one is its essentiality as essentiality of the ground, while the other is the immediacy of its determinate being. Or rather, both are the same. Determinate being is an immediate, but the immediacy is essentially the mediated, namely, through the self-sublating ground. As this immediacy that is mediated by a self-sublating process of mediation, it is at the same time the in-itself of the ground and the unconditioned of its unconditioned side; but this in-itself is itself in turn also no less only a moment or a positedness, for it is mediated. Condition is accordingly the whole form of the ground relation; it is its presupposed in-itself, but as presupposed it is itself a positedness and its immediacy is this, to make itself into a positedness and so to repel itself from itself, in such a manner that it both falls to the ground and is ground, the ground making itself into a positedness and thus also into a grounded, and these two are one and the same thing.</p>

This ground is the self-subsistent, that is, the self-relating, reflection of the positing, and consequently the self-identical; or, it is in its own self its in-itself and its content. But it is also presupposing reflection; it is negatively related to itself and opposes its in-itself to itself as to an other, and condition, according to its moment of in-itself as well as according to its moment of immediate determinate being, is the ground-relation&#39;s own moment; the immediate determinate being is essentially only through its ground and is moment of itself as a presupposing. This ground, therefore, is equally the whole itself.</p>

For the peculiar content of condition is essential content only in so far as it is the self-identity of reflection in the form, or, as this immediate determinate being is in its own self the ground-relation. Further, this immediate determinate being is only condition through the presupposing reflection of the ground; it is the self-identity of the ground, or its content, to which it opposes itself. Therefore the determinate being is not merely formless material for the ground relation; on the contrary, because it has in its own self this form it is a formed matter, and since also in its identity with it it is indifferent to it, it is content. Finally, it is the same content as that possessed by ground, for it is content precisely as that which is self-identical in the form relation.</p>

They spontaneously pass over into one another or, since they are reflections, they posit themselves as sublated, relate themselves to this their negation and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reciprocally presuppose one another.&nbsp;</em>But at the same time this is only a single reflection of both and therefore their presupposing is also only one; or rather this reciprocal presupposing becomes a presupposing of their one identity as their subsistence and substrate. This identity of their common content and unity of form is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truly unconditioned, the fact in its own self.&nbsp;</em>As we saw above, condition is only the relatively unconditioned. It is therefore usually regarded as itself conditioned and a fresh condition is asked for, and thus the usual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite progress&nbsp;</em>from condition to condition is introduced. Now why does a condition prompt us to ask for a fresh condition, that is, why is a condition regarded as a conditioned? Because it is some finite determinate being or other. But this is a further determination, which is not contained in its Notion. Condition as such is conditioned, solely because it is a posited in-itself; it is therefore sublated in the absolutely unconditioned.</p>

Together they constitute its form or positedness. The unconditioned fact is condition of both, but it is absolute condition, that is, condition that is itself ground. Now as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>it is the negative identity that has repelled itself into these two moments; first, into the shape of the sublated ground relation, of an immediate, self-external manifoldness, without unity, which relates itself to the ground as something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>to it, and at the same time constitutes the ground&#39;s in-itself; secondly, into the shape of an internal, simple form, which is ground, but relates itself to the self-identical immediate as to an other and determines it as condition, that is, determines this its in-itself as its own moment. These two sides&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppose&nbsp;</em>the totality in such a manner that it is that which posits them. Conversely, because they&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppose the</em>&nbsp;totality, this in turn also seems to be conditioned by them, and the fact seems to arise from its condition and from its ground. But since these two sides have shown themselves to be an identity, the relation of condition and ground has vanished; they are reduced to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an illusory being;&nbsp;</em>the absolutely unconditioned in its movement of positing and presupposing is only the movement in which this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being&nbsp;</em>sublates itself. It is the fact&#39;s own act to condition itself and to oppose itself as ground to its conditions; but its relation, as a relation between conditions and ground, is a reflection&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into itself,&nbsp;</em>and its relation to them is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">union with itself.</em></p>

As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>it relates itself negatively to itself, makes itself into a positedness; but this positedness is a reflection that is complete in both its aspects and a form-relation that is self-identical in them as we have seen from their Notion. This positedness is accordingly, first, the sublated ground, the fact as the reflectionless immediate-the side of conditions. This is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>of the determinations of the fact-the fact itself, but cast out into the externality of being, the restored sphere of being. In condition, essence releases the unity of its reflection-into-self as an immediacy, which however from now on has the character of being a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditioning</em>&nbsp;presupposition and of essentially constituting only one of the sides of essence. The conditions are, therefore, the whole content of the fact, because they are the unconditioned in the form of formless being. But they also have, by reason of this form, another shape besides the determinations of the content as it is in the fact as such. They appear as a multiplicity without unity, mixed with non-essentials and other circumstances that do not belong to the sphere of determinate being in so far as this constitutes the conditions of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>fact. For the absolute, unrestricted fact, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of being itself&nbsp;</em>is the condition. The ground, which withdraws into itself, posits condition as the first immediacy and it relates itself to this as to its unconditioned. This immediacy as sublated reflection is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection&nbsp;</em>in the element of being, which thus develops itself as such into a whole; the form, as a determinateness of being, goes on to multiply itself and thus appears as a manifold content distinct from and indifferent to the determination of reflection. The unessential, which belongs to the sphere of being and which the latter, in so far as it is condition, strips off, is the determinateness of immediacy in which the unity of form is submerged. This form unity, as the relation of being, is present in it at first as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming-the&nbsp;</em>transition of one determinateness of being into another. But the becoming of being is further the transition to essence and the withdrawal into ground. The determinate being, therefore, that constitutes the conditions is, in truth, not determined as condition by something else and used by it as material; on the contrary, it is through its own act that it makes itself into a moment of another. Also, far from its becoming starting from itself as the true first and immediate, the truth is that its immediacy is only something presupposed, and the movement of its becoming is the act of reflection itself. Accordingly the truth of determinate being is to be condition; its immediacy is, solely through the reflection of the ground-relation which posits itself as sublated. Becoming is, therefore, like immediacy, only the illusory being of the unconditioned, in that this presupposes itself and therein has its form; and the immediacy of being is accordingly essentially only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment&nbsp;</em>of the form.</p>

But it is the form of the absolute fact, and it possesses within itself the unity of its form with itself, or its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content;&nbsp;</em>and in the very act of determining this content to be condition it sublates the diversity of the content and reduces it to a moment, just as, conversely, as essenceless form it gives itself the immediacy of a subsistence in this self-identity. The reflection of the ground sublates the immediacy of the conditions and relates them, so making them moments in the unity of the fact; but the conditions are presupposed by the unconditioned fact itself, which thus sublates its own positing, or its positing directly converts itself equally into a becoming. The two are therefore one unity; the immanent movement of the conditions is a becoming, a withdrawal into ground to the positing of ground; but the ground as posited, that is to say, as sublated, is the immediate. The ground relates itself negatively to itself, makes itself into a positedness and grounds the conditions; but in thus determining immediate determinate being as a posited, the ground sublates it and thereby first constitutes itself ground. This reflection is accordingly the mediation of the unconditioned fact with itself through its negation. Or rather, the reflection of the unconditioned is at first a presupposing-but this sublating of itself is immediately a positing which determines; secondly, in this presupposing, reflection is immediately a sublating of what is presupposed and a determining from within itself; thus this determining is again a sublating of the positing and is in its own self a becoming. In this, the mediation as a return-to-self through negation has vanished; it is the simple, internal movement of reflection [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">einfache, in sich scheinende Reflexion</em>] and groundless absolute becoming. The movement of the fact to become posited, on the one hand through its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditions,&nbsp;</em>and on the other through its ground, is merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing of the illusion of mediation.&nbsp;</em>The process by which the fact is posited is accordingly an emergence, the simple entry of the fact&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into Existence,&nbsp;</em>the pure movement of the fact to itself.</p>

When, therefore, all the conditions of the fact are present, that is when the totality of the fact is posited as a groundless immediate, this scattered multiplicity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwardises&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">erinnert</em>] itself in its own self. The whole fact must be present in its conditions, or all the conditions belong to its Existence, for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all&nbsp;</em>of them constitute the reflection; or, determinate being, because it is condition, is determined by form; consequently its determinations are determinations of reflection and the positing of one essentially involves the positing of the others. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwardisation&nbsp;</em>of the conditions is at first the falling to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Zugrundegehen</em>] of immediate determinate being and the becoming of the ground. But this makes the ground a posited ground, that is, it is just as much sublated ground and immediate being, as it is ground. When therefore all the conditions of the fact are present, they sublate themselves as immediate being and presupposition, and equally ground sublates itself. Ground emerges merely as an illusory being that immediately vanishes; accordingly, this emergence is the tautological movement of the fact to itself, and its mediation by conditions and ground is the vanishing of both. The emergence into Existence is therefore immediate in such a manner that it is mediated only by the vanishing of mediation.</p>

Through its union with the conditions, ground receives an external immediacy and the moment of being. But it receives this not as something external, nor through an external relation; on the contrary, as ground, it makes itself into a positedness, its simple essentiality unites with itself in the positedness and is, in this sublation of itself, the vanishing of its difference from its positedness, and is thus simple essential immediacy. Ground, therefore, does not remain behind as something distinct from the grounded, but the truth of grounding is that in it ground is united with itself, so that its reflection into another is its reflection into itself. Consequently, the fact is not only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned&nbsp;</em>but also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">groundless,</em>and it emerges from ground only in so far as ground has &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fallen to the ground</em>&#39; and ceased to be ground: it emerges from the groundless, that is, from its own essential negativity or pure form.</p>

Reflection is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">showing of illusory being within essence itself</em>. Its determinations are enclosed within the unity simply and solely as posited, sublated determinations; or, reflection is essence which, in its positedness, is immediately identical with itself. But since essence is ground, it gives itself a real determination through its reflection, which is self-sublating or which returns into itself; further, since this determination, or the otherness, of the ground relation sublates itself in the reflection of the ground and becomes Existence, this endows the form determinations with an element of self-subsistence. Their illusory being completes itself to become&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Appearance</em>.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px;"><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">Proof is, in general,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated cognition</em>. The various kinds of being demand or imply their own kind of mediation, so that the nature of proof too, will differ in respect of each</span>. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ontological proof</em>&nbsp;proposes to start from the Notion; it makes the sum total of all realities its basis and then proceeds to subsume existence, too, under reality. It is therefore the mediation that is syllogism and that does not as yet come up for consideration here. We have already considered above Kant&#39;s objections to this proof and have remarked that Kant understands by Existence, the determinate being whereby something enters into the context of the totality of experience, that is, into the determination of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">otherness&nbsp;</em>and into relation to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>Thus something, as existent, is mediated by an other, and existence in general is the side of its mediation. Now what Kant calls a concept, namely, something taken as only simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related,&nbsp;</em>or conception as such, does not contain its mediation; in abstract self-identity, opposition is left out. The ontological proof would now have to demonstrate that the absolute concept, namely the concept of God, attains to a determinate being, to a mediation, or how simple essence mediates itself with mediation. This is effected by the stated subsumption of existence under its universal, namely, reality, which is assumed as the middle term between God in his concept, on the one hand, and existence on the other. This mediation, in so far as it has the form of a syllogism, is, as we have said, not under discussion here. But the preceding exposition has shown what is the true nature of this mediation of essence with Existence. The nature of proof itself will be considered in the doctrine of cognition. Here we have only to indicate what is relevant to the nature of mediation in general.</p>

It is not supposed to be an objective ground of God&#39;s existence; for this existence is in and for itself. Thus it is merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground for cognition.&nbsp;</em>It thereby declares itself to be a ground that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishes&nbsp;</em>in the object which at first appears to be grounded by it. Now the ground that is derived from the contingency of the world implies the regress of the contingency into absolute essence; for the contingent is that which is in itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">groundless&nbsp;</em>and self-sublating. In this way, therefore, absolute essence does in fact proceed from the groundless; the ground sublates itself and with this there also vanishes the illusion of the relation that was given to God, to be that which is grounded in an other. This mediation is therefore true mediation. But this nature of its mediation is unknown to that ratiocinative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beweisende</em>] reflection; on the one hand, it takes itself to be something merely subjective and by so doing removes its mediation from God himself, but, on the other hand, it does not for that reason recognise the mediating movement, that it is and how it is in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence itself.&nbsp;</em>Its true relationship consists in this, that it is both of these things in one: mediation as such but, of course, at the same time a subjective, external, that is, self-external, mediation, which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublates itself again within itself.&nbsp;</em>But in the above proof, existence is given the false relationship of appearing only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated&nbsp;</em>or posited.</p>

This is also evident from the foregoing; only we must add that reflection, in ending with the sublating of itself, does not therefore have for result&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing&nbsp;</em>(for in that case the positive knowledge of essence as an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation to it would be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separate&nbsp;</em>from that result and a spontaneous emergence, an act starting only from itself); on the contrary, this end itself, this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">falling to the ground&nbsp;</em>of the mediation, is at the same time the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground</em>&nbsp;from which the immediate proceeds.

It falls to the ground and thus itself becomes essential identity or thing-in-itself. This can also be considered in the following manner: essenceless Existence has in the thing-in-itself its reflection-into-self; it is related to it in the first instance as to its other; but as the other over against that which is in itself, it is the sublating of its own self and the becoming of being-in-self.

The thing-in-itself is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related,&nbsp;</em>essential Existence; it is identity-with-self only in so far as it contains within itself the negativity of reflection-into-itself; consequently that which appeared as an Existence external to it is a moment within it.

This unessential Existence is their relation to one another as to others; but further, it is essential to these others themselves-or, in other words, this unessential Existence in collapsing within itself is a thing-in-itself, but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>than the first thing-in-itself; for the former is an immediate essentiality, the latter, however, the essentiality that has emerged from unessential Existence.

The things-in-themselves are thus the extremes of a syllogism whose middle term constitutes their external Existence, the Existence through which they are others for one another and distinct from one another. This their difference falls&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only in their relation;</em>&nbsp;they send, as it were, determinations only from their surface into the relation and remain themselves, as absolutely reflected into themselves, indifferent towards the relation. Now this relationship constitutes the totality of Existence. The thing-in-itself stands in relation to a reflection external to it in which it possesses a multiplicity of determinations; this is the repelling of itself from itself into another thing-in-itself; this repelling is the counter-thrust of itself internally, since each is only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>as a reflecting of itself out of the other; it has its positedness not in its own self but in the other, is determined only by the determinateness of the other; this other is equally determined only by the determinateness of the first. But the two things-in-themselves, since thus they do not contain the difference within themselves but each has it only in the other, are not distinguished from one another; the thing-in-itself, since it is supposed to be related to the other extreme as to another thing-in-itself, is related to it as something that is not distinguished from it, and the external reflection, which should constitute the mediating connection between the extremes, is only a relating of the thing-&#39;n-itself to itself, or essentially its reflection into itself; it is therefore only an implicit determinateness, or the determinateness of the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself, therefore, has the determinateness, not in a relation (external to it) to another thing-in-itself, and of this other to it; the determinateness is not merely a surface of the thing-in-itself but is the essential mediation of itself with itself as with an other. The two things-inthemselves which are supposed to constitute the extremes of the relation, since they are supposed not to possess in themselves any determinateness over against one another,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intact collapse into one;</em>&nbsp;there is only one thing-in-itself, which in external reflection is related to itself, and it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own self-relation as to an other&nbsp;</em>that constitutes its determinateness.</p>

In this consciousness of its freedom the ego is to itself that true identity reflected into itself, which the thing-in-itself was supposed to be. 1 have shown elsewhere that this transcendental idealism does not get away from the limitation of the ego by the object, in general, from the finite world, but only changes the form of the limitation, which remains for it an absolute, merely giving it a subjective instead of an objective shape and making into determinatenesses of the ego and into a turbulent whirlpool of change within it (as if the ego were a thing) that which the ordinary consciousness knows as a manifoldness and alteration belonging only to things external to it. At present we are considering only the thing-in-itself and the reflection which is in the first instance external to it; this reflection has not yet determined itself to consciousness, nor the thing-in-itself to ego. We have seen from the nature of the thing-in-itself and of external reflection that this same external reflection determines itself to be the thing-in-itself, or, conversely, becomes the first thing-in-itself&#39;s own determination.</p>

Thinghood is thus reduced to the form of indeterminate identity-with-self which has its essentiality only in its property. If, therefore, one is speaking of a thing or things in general without any determinate property, then their difference is merely indifferent, quantitative. What is considered as one thing can equally be made into or considered as several things; the separation or union of them is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external.&nbsp;</em>A book is a thing and each of its leaves is also a thing, and so too is each bit of its pages, and so on to infinity. The determinateness through which one thing is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing only, lies solely in its properties. Through them it distinguishes itself from other things, because property is negative reflection and a distinguishing; the thing therefore contains the difference of itself from other things solely in its property. This is the difference reflected into itself, through which the thing, in its positedness, that is, in its relation to another, is at the same time indifferent to the other and to its relation to it. All that remains therefore to the thing without its properties is abstract being-in-self or initselfness, an unessential compass and external holding together. The true in-itself is the in-itself in its positedness: and this is property. With this,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinghood has passed over into property.</em></p>

This, therefore, is not that which is sublated in the thing, nor is it the thing&#39;s mere moment; on the contrary, the thing is, in truth, only that unessential compass which, though a negative unity, is only like the one of something, namely an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>one. Previously the thing was determined as an unessential compass in so far as it was made such by external abstraction which strips it of its property; but now this abstraction has happened through the transition of the thing-in-itself into property itself, but with inversion of the values: whereas in the former act of abstraction the abstract thing without its property was still vaguely conceived of as the essential, but the property as an external determination, here the thing as such spontaneously determines itself into an indifferent external form of the property. Hence property is now freed from the indeterminate and impotent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>which is the one of the thing: it is that which constitutes the thing&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence, a self-subsistent matter.&nbsp;</em>Since this is a simple continuity with itself it possesses form, in the first instance, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as diversity;&nbsp;</em>consequently there are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">various&nbsp;</em>self-subsistent matters of this kind and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the thing consists of them.</em></p>

Equally current is the expression that things&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist of</em>&nbsp;various matters. One is careful not to call these matters things; although it would certainly be admitted that, e.g. a pigment is a thing; but I do not know whether e.g. luminous matter, heat matter or electrical matter and so on, are also called things. Things and their constituents are distinguished without it being exactly stated whether and to what extent the latter are also things or perhaps only half things; but they are at least existents in general.</p>

But at the same time, the reflection of property into itself constitutes only one side of the whole reflection; namely, the sublating of the difference and the continuity of the property (which was supposed to be an Existence for an other) with itself. Thinghood, as negative reflection-into-self and a distinguishing which repels itself from an other, is thereby reduced to an unessential moment; but in this process it has at the same time further determined itself. First, this negative moment has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preserved&nbsp;</em>itself; for property has become continuous with itself and a self-subsistent matter only in so far as the difference of things has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublated&nbsp;</em>itself; the continuity of the property into otherness therefore itself contains the moment of the negative, and its self-subsistence is, as this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative unity,</em>&nbsp;the restored&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>of thinghood; the negative self-subsistence over against the positive of matter. Secondly, through this the thing has advanced from its indeterminateness to complete determinateness. As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thing-in-itself&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>identity, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply negative&nbsp;</em>Existence, or Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined&nbsp;</em>as the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate;</em>&nbsp;next, the thing is determined by its properties, by which it is supposed to be distinguished from other things; but it is, in fact, through property that it is continuous with other things and consequently this incomplete difference sublates itself. Through this the thing has returned into itself and is now determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate;&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself determinate or this&nbsp;</em>thing.</p>

Property is not only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>determination but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intrinsic&nbsp;</em>Existence. This unity of externality and essentiality, because it contains reflection-into-self and reflection-into-an-other, repels itself from itself, and is, on the one hand, determination as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple,&nbsp;</em>self-identical, self-related self-subsistence in which the negative unity, the one of the thing, is sublated; on the other hand, it is this determination over against an other, but likewise as a one reflected into itself and intrinsically determinate; it is therefore the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matters and this thing.&nbsp;</em>These are the two moments of the externality which is identical with itself, or of the property reflected into itself. Property was that by which things were supposed to be distinguished; but now that it has freed itself from this its negative side, of inhering in an other, the thing, too, has been freed from its being determined by other things and has returned into itself from the relation to other; but it is at the same time only the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thing-in-itself that has become an other to itself,&nbsp;</em>because the manifold properties on their part have become independent and therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their negative relation in the one of the thing&nbsp;</em>is only a sublated relation. For this reason, the thing is a self-identical negation only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as against&nbsp;</em>the positive continuity of the matter.</p>

Therefore in their combination in the latter they do not sublate themselves; as self-subsistent they are impenetrable for one another, relate themselves in their determinateness only to themselves, and are a mutually indifferent manifoldness of subsistence; they are capable only of a quantitative limit. The thing as &#39;this&#39; is this their merely quantitative relation, a mere collection, their &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also</em>&#39;. It<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consists&nbsp;</em>of some quantum or other of a matter,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>of a quantum of another, and again of others; this connection of having no connection alone constitutes the thing.</p>

Its alteration consists in the exclusion from the collection or the addition to this &#39;also,&#39; of one or more matters, or in the alteration of their quantitative relationship to one another. The coming-to-be and passing away of &#39;this&#39; thing is the external dissolution of such external combination or the combination of matters to which it is indifferent whether they are combined or not. Matters circulate freely out of or into &#39;this&#39; thing; the thing itself is absolute porosity without measure or form of its own.</p>

This dissolution is an external process of being determined, as also is the being of the thing; but its dissolution and the externality of its being is the essential element of this being; it is only the &#39;also&#39;, and consists only in this externality. But it also consists of its matters, and not only the abstract &#39;this&#39; as such, but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole of &#39;this&#39; thing&nbsp;</em>is the dissolution of itself. The thing, namely, is determined as an external collection of self-subsistent matters; these matters are not things, they do not have negative self-subsistence; but they are the properties as self-subsistents, that is, they are determinate and the determinateness is, as such, reflected into itself. The matters, therefore, are indeed simple and are only self-related; but their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness;&nbsp;</em>reflection-into-self is only the form of this content, which is not as such reflected into itself but, in accordance with its determinateness, relates&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself to an other.&nbsp;</em>The thing is, therefore, not merely the &#39;also&#39; of the matters &mdash; their relation as mutually indifferent &mdash; but equally their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative</em>&nbsp;relation; on account of their determinateness the matters themselves are this their negative reflection, which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">puncticity of</em>&nbsp;the thing. One matter is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that&nbsp;</em>which the other is, in accordance with the determinateness of their content as against one another; and one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>not, in so far as the other is, in accordance with their self-subsistence.</p>

In so far therefore as the one matter is in the thing, the other is thereby sublated; but the thing is at the same time the &#39;also&#39;, or the subsistence of the others. In the subsistence of the one matter, the other, therefore, does not subsist, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>it no less subsists in the former; and so with all these diverse matters reciprocally. Since, therefore, in the same respect as the one subsists the others also subsist, this one subsistence of them being the puncticity or negative unity of the thing, they thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply interpenetrate&nbsp;</em>one another; and since the thing is at the same time only the &#39;also&#39; of them, and the matters are reflected into their determinateness, they are indifferent to one another and in their interpenetration&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">do not touch</em>one another. The matters are therefore essentially porous, so that one subsists in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pores&nbsp;</em>or in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-stibsistence&nbsp;</em>of the others; but these others are themselves porous; in their pores or non-subsistence the first and all the others also subsist; their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence&nbsp;</em>is at the same time their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublatedness</em>&nbsp;and the subsistence of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">others;&nbsp;</em>and this subsistence of the others is equally this their sublatedness and the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence of the first,&nbsp;</em>and in the same way of all the others. The thing is, therefore, the selfcontradictory mediation of independent self-subsistence through its opposite, namely, through its negation, or of one self-subsistent matter through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence and non-subsistence&nbsp;</em>of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this thing,&nbsp;</em>Existence has reached its completion, namely, it is intrinsic being or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">independent&nbsp;</em>subsistence, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unessential&nbsp;</em>Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one;&nbsp;</em>hence the truth of Existence is to have its being-in-self in unessentiality, or its subsisting in an other, and that, too, the absolute other, or that it has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own nullity&nbsp;</em>for substrate.

Both properties and matters are the same&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content-determinations;&nbsp;</em>only in the former case they are moments, that is, they are reflected into their negative unity as into a substrate distinct from them, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinghood,&nbsp;</em>and in the latter case they are self-subsistent, different determinations, each of which is reflected into its own unity-with-self. These matters are now further determined as an independent subsistence; but they are also together in a thing. This thing has the two determinations of being first,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing, and secondly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;also&#39;.&nbsp;</em>The &#39;also&#39; is that which presents itself in external intuition as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial extension;&nbsp;</em>but the &#39;this&#39;, the negative unity, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">puncticity</em>&nbsp;of the thing. The matters are together in the puncticity, and their talso&#39; or the extension is everywhere this puncticity; for the &#39;also&#39; as thinghood is essentially also determined as a negative unity. Therefore where one of these matters is, the other also is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one and the same point;&nbsp;</em>the thing does not have its colour in one place, its odorific matter in another, its heat matter in a third, and so on, but in the point in which it is warm, it is also coloured, sour, electric, and so on. Now because these matters are not outside one another but are in one &#39;this&#39;, they are assumed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">porous,&nbsp;</em>so that one exists in the interstices of the other. But that which is present in the interstices of the other matter is itself porous; conversely, therefore, in its pores the other exists; but not only this matter but the third, tenth, and so on. They are all porous and in the interstices of each all the others are present, just as each, with all the rest, is present in the pores of every other. Accordingly they are a multiplicity which interpenetrate one another in such a manner that those which penetrate are equally penetrated by the others, so that each again penetrates its own penetratedness. Each is posited as its negation, and this negation is the subsistence of another; but this subsistence is equally the negation of this other, and the subsistence of the first.</p>

For pictorial thinking, in the first place contains the contradiction of wanting to hold on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">perception&nbsp;</em>and to have before it things that have real being, and secondly, of ascribing a sensible existence to the imperceptible, to what is determined by reflection; the minute parts and pores are at the same time supposed to be a sensible existence and their positedness is spoken of as if it had the same kind of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality&nbsp;</em>as that which belongs to colour, heat, etc. If, further, pictorial thinking considered more closely this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective&nbsp;</em>nebulosity, the pores and the minute particles, it would recognise in it not only a matter and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>its negation, so that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">here&nbsp;</em>there would be matter and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>it its negation, the pore, and alongside this, matter again, and so on, but also that in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing it has,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one and the same point,</em><span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</span><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>matter, and&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(2)</span>&nbsp;its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>or porosity and the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>matter, and that this porosity and the independent subsistence of the matters in one another as in a single point is a reciprocal negation and a penetration of the penetration.</p>

They show, namely, that for example a certain volume takes up the same amount of steam whether it is empty of atmospheric air or filled with it; and also that the various gases diffuse themselves in one another in such a manner that each is as good as a vacuum for the other, or at least that they are not in any kind of chemical combination with one another, each remains uninterrupted by the other and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous with itself and in its interpenetration with the others keeps itself indifferent&nbsp;</em>to them. But the further moment in the Notion of the thing is that in this thing one matter is present where the other matter is, and the matter that penetrates is also penetrated in the same point; in other words, the self-subsistent is immediately the self-subsistence of an other. This is contradictory; but the thing is nothing else but this very contradiction; and that is why it is Appearance.</p>

Spirit is, in a much deeper sense this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one thing,&nbsp;</em>the negative unity in which its determinations interpenetrate one another.

It is imagined that the intellect acts separately in one place and the imagination by itself in another, that intellect, memory, and so on, are each cultivated separately, and for the time being the other forces are left inactive on one side until perhaps, or perhaps not, their turn comes. In placing them in the materially simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">soul thing&nbsp;</em>which as simple is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immaterial, the</em>&nbsp;faculties are not, it is true, represented as particular matters; but as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">forces&nbsp;</em>they are taken as equally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent</em>to one another as the said matters. But spirit is not that contradiction which the thing is, which dissolves itself and passes over into Appearance; on the contrary, it is already in its own self the contradiction that has returned into its absolute unity, namely, the Notion, in which the differences are no longer to be thought of as independent, but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as particular,&nbsp;</em>moments in the subject, in the simple individuality.</p>

On the contrary, as we have seen, this essentiality of Existence which constitutes its Appearance, is the truth of Existence itself. The reflection by virtue of which it is this, is its own.</p>

When&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Appearance&nbsp;</em>is called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essenceless,</em>&nbsp;one thinks of the moment of its negativity as though the immediate by contrast were the positive and the true; but the fact is that this immediate does not as yet contain the essential truth. it is when Existence passes over into Appearance that it ceases to be essenceless.</p>

The connection of the reciprocally grounding existents consists therefore in this reciprocal negation, namely, that the subsistence of the one is not the subsistence of the other, but is its positedness, which relation of the positedness alone constitutes the subsistence of the existents.

In law two content determinations are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentially&nbsp;</em>connected (for instance, in the law of descent of a falling body, spatial and temporal magnitudes: spaces passed through vary as the squares of the times elapsed); they are connected; this relation is at first only an immediate one. It is, therefore, likewise at first only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>relation, the immediate in general having obtained in Appearance the meaning of positedness. The essential unity of the two sides of the law would be their negativity, that is to say, the one would contain its other within itself; but this essential unity has not yet emerged in the law. (That is why the Notion of the space traversed by a falling body does not itself imply that time corresponds to it as a square. Because fall is a sensible movement it is the relation of time and space; but first, the determination of time-that is, time as it is commonly imagined-does not itself imply its relationship to space, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa;&nbsp;</em>it is said that time can quite well be imagined without space and space without time; thus the one comes only externally into relation with the other, which external relation is motion. Secondly, the further determination is indifferent, namely, the magnitudes in accordance with which space and time are related in motion. The law of this relationship is empirically ascertained and in so far it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate;&nbsp;</em>it still demands a proof, that is, a mediation for cognition, showing that the law not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occurs&nbsp;</em>but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary</em>; the law as such does not contain this proof and its objective necessity.) Law is, therefore, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the positive,&nbsp;</em>and not the negative, essentiality of Appearance. In the latter, the content determinations are moments of form, as such passing over into their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>and in themselves are equally not themselves but their other. Accordingly, though in law the positedness of one side of it is the positedness of the other, their content is indifferent to this relation: the content does not itself therefore, is indeed essential form, contain this positedness.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">Law, therefore, is indeed essential form, but not as yet real form, which is reflected into its sides as content</span>.</p>

Law is this simple identity of Appearance with itself and therefore its substrate, not its ground; for it is not the negative unity of Appearance but, as its simple identity, the immediate, that is abstract unity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside</em>which therefore its other content also occurs. The content is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>content, internally coherent, or has its negative reflection within itself.

But as a phenomenon it is essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflected into its non-being,&nbsp;</em>or its identity is itself essentially no less its negativity and its other. Therefore the reflection-into-self of Appearance, namely law, is not only the identical substrate of Appearance, but the latter also has its opposite in law and law is its negative unity.</p>

At first, it is merely a diverse content and the formal reflection of positedness into itself, so that the positedness of one of its sides is the positedness of the other. But because it is also negative reflection-into-self, its sides are in their relationship not merely different but are negatively related to each other. Or, when law is considered merely on its own, the sides of its content are indifferent to each other; but equally they are sublated by their identity; the positedness of one is the positedness of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>and therefore the subsistence of each is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-subsistence of itself.&nbsp;</em>This positedness of one in the other is their negative unity and each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not only the positedness of itself but also of the other,&nbsp;</em>or, each is itself this negative unity. The positive identity which they have in law as such is at first only their inner unity which stands in need of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proof and mediation,&nbsp;</em>because this negative is not as yet posited in them. But since the different sides of law are now determined as being different in their negative unity, or such that each of them contains its other within it, and at the same time, as a self-subsistent side, repels this its otherness from itself, the identity of law is therefore now also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited and&nbsp;</em>real identity.</p>

Existence has thus completely withdrawn into itself and has reflected itself into its absolute otherness in and for itself. That which was previously law is accordingly no longer only one side of the whole whose other side was Appearance as such, but is itself the whole. Existence is the essential totality of Appearance, so that it now contains the moment of unessentiality which still belonged to Appearance, but as reflected, implicit unessentiality, that is, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential negativity.&nbsp;</em>As an immediate content, law is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>in general, distinguished from other laws, and of these there is an indeterminable number. But since it now has within it essential negativity it no longer contains such a merely indifferent, contingent content determination; on the contrary, its content is all determinateness whatsoever, in an essential relation developing itself into totality. Thus Appearance which is reflected into itself is now a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">world,</em>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reveals&nbsp;</em>itself as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">world in and for itself&nbsp;</em>above the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of Appearance.</em></p>

But now since it is the total reflection of this world it also contains the moment of its essenceless manifoldness. This moment of alterableness and alteration as reflected into self, as essential, is absolute negativity or pure form as such, whose moments however in the world in and for itself have the reality of self-subsistent but reflected Existence; just as, conversely, this reflected self-subsistence now has form within itself, by virtue of which its content is not a merely manifold, but an essentially self-coherent, content.</p>

It is only as things of another, supersensuous world that things are posited first, as veritable Existences, and secondly as the true in contrast to what has simply affirmative being; in them it is acknowledged that there is a being distinct from immediate being, a being that is veritable Existence. On the one hand, the sensuous representation which ascribes Existence only to the immediate being of feeling and intuition is overcome in this determination; but, on the other hand, there is also in it unconscious reflection which, though having the conception of things, forces, the inner, and so on, does not know that such determinations are not sensuous or simply affirmative immediacies, but reflected Existences.</p>

Thus, because it is totality, it is also only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one side</em>&nbsp;of it, and in this determination constitutes a self-subsistence distinct from the world of Appearance. The world of Appearance has in the essential world its negative unity in which it falls to the ground and into which it withdraws as into its ground. Further, the essential world is. also the positing ground of the world of Appearance; for, containing the absolute form in its essentiality, its identity sublates itself, makes itself into positedness and as this posited immediacy is the world of Appearance.</p>

As the realm of laws, it is already a manifold content, namely, the essential content of the world of Appearance, and as ground with a content, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>ground of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>world, but only in respect of this content; for the world of Appearance still had other manifold content than the realm of laws, because the negative moment was still peculiarly its own. But since the realm of laws now likewise contains this moment, it is the totality of the content of the world of Appearance and the ground of all its manifoldness. But it is at the same time the negative of this totality and as such is the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed&nbsp;</em>to it. That is to say, in the identity of both worlds, one of them is determined in respect of form as essential and the other as the same world but as posited and unessential, so that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground relation&nbsp;</em>has, it is true, been restored; but it is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground relation of Appearance,</em>&nbsp;namely, as relation not of an identical content, nor of a merely diverse one, as is law, but as total relation, or as negative identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and essential relation of the opposed sides of the content.&nbsp;</em>The realm of laws is not only this, that the positedness of a content is the positedness of another, but this identity is essentially, as we have seen, also a negative unity; each of the two sides of law is, in the negative unity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self its other&nbsp;</em>content; accordingly the other is not an indeterminate other in general, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>other, or, it too contains the content determination of the first; and thus the two sides are opposed. Now since the realm of Laws contains within it this negative moment and opposition, and hence as totality repels itself from itself into a world in and for itself and a world of Appearance, the identity of both is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential relation of opposition.&nbsp;</em>The ground relation as such is the opposition which, in its contradiction, has fallen to the ground; and Existence is the ground that has united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself</em>. But Existence becomes Appearance; ground is sublated in Existence; it reinstates itself as the return of Appearance into itself, but at the same time as sublated ground, namely, as ground relation of opposed determinations; but the identity of such determinations is essentially a becoming and a transition, no longer the ground relation as such.</p>

The reflective determinations of positive and negative are likewise reflected into themselves only as reflected into their opposites; but they have no other determination but this their negative unity. The sides of the essential relation, on the other hand, are posited as self-subsistent totalities. It is the same opposition as that of positive and negative, but at the same time as an inverted world. The side of the essential relation is a totality which, however, as essentially an opposite, has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>of itself; it is only Appearance; its Existence is not its own, but rather that of its other. It is therefore disrupted within itself; but this its sublatedness consists in its being the unity of itself and its other, therefore a whole, and precisely for this reason it has self-subsistent Existence and is essential reflection-into-self.</p>

Secondly, with this identity the other side, too, is immediately posited: the immediate self-subsistence which, determined as the other, is within itself a manifold variety, but such that this manifoldness essentially also has within it the relation of the other side, the unity of the reflected self-subsistence. The first side, the whole, is the self-subsistence which constituted the world in and for itself; the second side, the parts, is the immediate Existence which was the world of Appearance. In the relationship of whole and parts the two sides are these self-subsistences but in such a manner that each has the other reflected in it and at the same time only is as this identity of both. Now because the essential relation is at first only the first, immediate relation, the negative unity and the positive self-subsistence are connected by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;also&#39;;&nbsp;</em>both sides are indeed posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments, but equally&nbsp;</em>as existent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistences.&nbsp;</em>Accordingly the distribution of these two posited moments is as follows.

But at the same time the parts, as a manifold Existence, collapse within themselves, for this Existence is reflectionless being; they have their self-subsistence only in the reflected unity which is both this unity and also the existent manifoldness; that is to say, they have self-subsistence only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in the whole,&nbsp;</em>but at the same time, the whole is a self-subsistent other to the parts.</p>

Secondly, this transition is not only a becoming and vanishing, but is a negative relation-to-self; or, that which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alters its determination&nbsp;</em>is at the same time reflected into itself and preserves itself; the movement of force is not so much a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transition</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&uuml;bergehen</em>] as a movement in which it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transposes itself</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sich selbst &uuml;ber setzt</em>] and in this alteration posited by itself remains what it is.

Now in so far as in this consideration we start from force as negative unity of itself and therefore as presupposing reflection, this is the same as when, in the expression of force, we start from the soliciting impulse. Thus force,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its Notion,&nbsp;</em>is at first determined as self-sublating identity, and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its reality&nbsp;</em>one of the two forces is determined as soliciting and the other as being solicited. But the Notion of force is simply the identity of positing and presupposing reflection, or of reflected and immediate unity; and each of these determinations is simply a moment, in unity, and thus is mediated by the other. But equally there is nothing in the two reciprocally related forces to determine which is to be the soliciting and which the solicited force; or rather both form determinations belong in the same manner to each. But this identity is not merely an external identity of comparison but an essential unity of the two.</p>

But they are essentially mediated. One of the forces is solicited; this impulse is a determination posited in it from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside.&nbsp;</em>But force itself is the presupposing reflection; essentially it reflects itself into itself and sublates the fact that the impulse is external. Accordingly, the fact that it is solicited is its own act, or, it is through its own determining that the other force is simply other and is the soliciting force. The soliciting force is negatively related to its other and so sublates the latter&#39;s externality, and in doing so it has a positing action; but it has this only by virtue of the presupposition of having another over against it; that is, it is itself soliciting only in so far as it has in it an externality, hence in so far as it is solicited. Or it solicits only in so far as it is solicited to solicit. And so, conversely, the first force is solicited only in so far as it itself solicits the other to solicit it, namely, the first force. Each of the two therefore receives the impulse from the other; but the impulse which it gives as active force consists in its receiving an impulse from the other; the impulse which it receives was solicited by itself. Both the impulse given and that received, or the active expression and the passive externality, are consequently not an immediate but are mediated, and so each of the two forces is itself the determinateness which the other has over against it, is mediated by the other, and this mediating other is, again, its own determinative positing.</p>

But the activity of force consists in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">expressing itself,&nbsp;</em>that is, as we have seen, in sublating externality and determining it as that in which it is identical with itself. Therefore what force in truth expresses is that its relation to other is relation to itself, that its passivity consists in its very activity. The impulse by which it is solicited into activity is its own soliciting; the externality which affects it is not an immediate but is mediated by force itself; just as its own essential identity-with-self is not immediate but is mediated by its negation. In other words, what force expresses is this, that its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality is identical</em>&nbsp;with its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwardness.</em></p>

Now this is posited in the expression of force; the reflected unity is essentially a becoming-other as translation of itself into externality; but the latter equally is immediately taken back into the former; the distinction between the self-subsistent forces is sublated; the expression of force is only a mediation of the reflected unity with itself. What is present is only an empty, transparent distinction, an illusory being, but this illusory being is the mediation which is the independent subsistence itself. Not only are they opposite determinations which sublate themselves within themselves, nor is their movement merely a transition; but partly the immediacy from which the beginning and the transition into otherness was made is itself only a posited immediacy, and partly, in consequence of this, each of the determinations is in its immediacy already the unity with its other, so that the transition is just as much the spontaneously posited return-into-self.</p>

This identity is first, the substantial unity of both as a substrate pregnant with content, or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute fact</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Sache</em>], in which the two determinations are indifferent, external moments. By virtue of this, it is a content and that totality which is the inner that equally becomes external, but in this externality is not the result of becoming or transition but is identical with itself. The outer, according to this determination, is not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical</em>&nbsp;with the inner in respect of content but both are only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one fact.&nbsp;</em>But this fact, as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple self-identity,&nbsp;</em>is distinct from its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form determinations,&nbsp;</em>or, these are external to it; it is thus itself an inner that is distinct from its externality. But this externality consists in its being constituted by the two determinations themselves, namely, the inner and the outer. But the fact is itself nothing else but the unity of both. Hence both sides are again the same in respect of content. But in the fact they are present as an interpenetrating identity, as a substrate pregnant with content. But in externality they are, as forms of the fact, indifferent to this identity and thus to each other.</p>

But the nature of the relation has shown that these determinations constitute one identity and one alone. Force in its expression is this, that the determining which presupposes and the determining which returns into itself are one and the same. In so far then as inner and outer have been considered as form-determinations, they are first only the simple form itself, and secondly, because in this form they are at the same time determined as opposite, their unity is pure,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract mediation&nbsp;</em>in which the one is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately</em>&nbsp;the other, and is the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">because&nbsp;</em>it is itself. Thus the inner is immediately only the outer, and it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination of externality</em>&nbsp;because it is the inner; conversely, the outer is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>an inner because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>an outer. That is to say, since this form unity contains its two determinations as opposites, their identity is only this transition, and therein only the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>of both, not their identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pregnant with content.&nbsp;</em>Or, this holding fast to form is in general the side of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness.&nbsp;</em>What is posited in accordance with this is not the real totality of the whole, but the totality or the fact itself only in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of form; since this unity is the mere conjunction of opposite determinations, then, when one of them is taken first-and it does not matter which-we must say of the substrate or fact that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for that reason&nbsp;</em>equally essentially in the other determinateness, but also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>in the other, just as we said before that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>in the first.</p>

Or conversely, something which is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>an outer is just for that reason only an inner. Or, if the inner is determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence&nbsp;</em>but the outer as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>then a fact, in so far as it is only in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence,&nbsp;</em>is for that very reason only an immediate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being;&nbsp;</em>or a fact which only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>is precisely for that reason as yet only in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence.&nbsp;</em>Outer and inner are determinateness posited in such wise that each of these two determinations not only presupposes the other and passes over into it as into its truth, but, in so far as it is this truth of the other, remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited as determinateness&nbsp;</em>and points to the totality of both. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner is</em>&nbsp;therefore the consummation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence&nbsp;</em>with respect to form. For essence, when it is determined as inner, implies that it is defective and is, only as relation to its other, the outer; but this, equally, is not merely being or even Existence, but relates itself to essence or the inner. But what is here present is not only the relation of the two to each other but the determinate relation of the absolute form in which each is immediately its opposite, and their common relation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to their third&nbsp;</em>or rather<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to their unity.&nbsp;</em>But their mediation still lacks this identical substrate that contains them both; hence their relation is the immediate conversion of the one into the other, and this negative unity which links them together is the simple point devoid of any content.</p>

In the relation of inner and outer, the essential moment of this emerges namely, that its determinations are posited as being in negative unity in such a manner that each immediately is not only it other but also the totality of the whole. But in the Notion as such this totality is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal-a&nbsp;</em>substrate which is not yet present in the relation of inner and outer. In the negative identity of inner and outer which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate conversion&nbsp;</em>of one of these determinations into the other, there is also lacking that substrate which above was called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fact.</em></p>

In</em>&nbsp;general, everything real is, in its beginning, such a merely immediate identity; for in its beginning it has not yet opposed and developed its moments; on the one hand it has not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwardised&nbsp;</em>itself out of externality. and on the other hand, it has not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externalised&nbsp;</em>and brought forth itself, out of inwardness by its activity. It is therefore only the inner&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as determinateness&nbsp;</em>against the outer, and only the outer as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>against the inner. Hence it is partly only an immediate being; partly, in so far as it is equally the negativity which is to be the activity of the development, it is as such essentially only as yet an inner.</p>

Thus the sphere of being as such is as yet still the completely inner and is therefore the sphere of simply affirmative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seienden</em>] immediacy or externality. Essence is at first only the inner, and it, too, is for this reason taken as a wholly external, unsystematised, common element; one speaks of public instruction, the press [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Schulwesen, Zeitungswesen</em>], and understands thereby something common formed by an external aggregation of existing objects lacking any essential connection or organisation; or to take concrete objects, the seed of the plant, or the child, is at first only inner&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plant</em>,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">internal</em>&nbsp;man</span>.

But these two identities are only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the sides of one totality;</em>or, the totality itself is only the conversion of one into the other. The totality as substrate and content is this immediacy, which is reflected into itself, only through the presupposing reflection of form which sublates their difference and posits itself as indifferent identity, as a reflected unity, over against it. Or, the content is the form itself in so far as this determines itself as difference, making itself into one of its sides as externality, but into the other as an immediacy that is reflected into itself, or into inner.</p>

This transition of each into the other is their immediate identity as substrate; but it is also their mediated identity; for it is precisely through its other that each is what it is in itself, the totality of the relation. Or, conversely, the determinateness of each side, because it is in itself the totality, is mediated with the other determinateness; thus the totality mediates itself with itself through the form or determinateness, and the determinateness is mediated with itself through its simple identity.</p>

Now because in the absolute, the form is only simple self-identity, the absolute does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determine&nbsp;</em>itself; for determination is a form difference which, in the first instance, counts as such. But because at the same time it contains all difference and form-determination whatever, or because it is itself the absolute form and reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the difference of the content&nbsp;</em>must also appear in it. But the absolute itself is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute identity;&nbsp;</em>this is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination,&nbsp;</em>for in it all manifoldness of the world-in-itself and the world of Appearance, or of inner and outer totality, is sublated. In the absolute itself is no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>for it is not being; not is it a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-reflecting&nbsp;</em>determining, for it is not essence which determines itself only inwardly; nor is it an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">uttering or expressing of itself</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sich &auml;ussern</em>], for it is the identity of inner and outer. But the movement of reflection thus stands over&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">against&nbsp;</em>the absolute identity of the absolute. In this identity it is sublated and thus is only the inner of it; but as inner, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;to it. At first, therefore, this movement consists only in sublating its act in the absolute. It is the beyond of the manifold differences and determinations and their movement, a beyond which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lies at the back of the absolute;&nbsp;</em>consequently, though it accepts them, it also destroys them; it is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative exposition&nbsp;</em>of the absolute previously mentioned. In its true presentation this exposition is the preceding whole of the logical movement of the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and essence,</em>the content of which has not been raked together from outside as something given and contingent, or submerged in the abyss of the absolute by a reflection alien to that content; on the contrary, it has determined itself internally through its inner necessity, and as being&#39;s own&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>and as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection&nbsp;</em>of essence, has withdrawn into the absolute as into its ground.</p>

But the transparency of the finite, which only lets the absolute be glimpsed through it, ends by completely vanishing; for there is nothing in the finite which could preserve for it a distinction against the absolute; it is a medium which is absorbed by that which is reflected through it.</p>

But because form is at the same time form of the absolute, the attribute is the whole content of the absolute; it is the totality which previously appeared as a world, or as one of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential relation,</em>each of which is itself the whole. But the two worlds, the world of Appearance and the world-in-and-for-itself, were supposed to be<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed&nbsp;</em>to each other in their essence. True, one side of the relation was equal to the other, the whole was equal to the parts, the expression of force the same content as force itself, and the outer altogether the same as the inner. But at the same time, each of these two sides was supposed to have as well an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>subsistence of its own, one as simply affirmative, the other as reflected immediacy. In the absolute, on the other hand, these distinguished immediacies are reduced to an illusory being, and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>which the attribute is is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited as its true and sole subsistence;&nbsp;</em>but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination&nbsp;</em>in which it is is posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unessential&nbsp;</em>subsistence.</p>

But because absolute identity has only this meaning, not merely that all determinations are sublated but that it is also the reflection that has sublated itself, therefore all determinations are<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in this identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as sublated.&nbsp;</em>Or the totality is posited as absolute, or the attribute has the absolute for its content and subsistence; its form determination, by virtue of which it is attribute, is therefore also posited, immediately as mere illusory being-the negative as a negative. The positive illusory being which the exposition gives itself through the attribute, in that it does not take the finite in its limitation to be something existing in and for itself but dissolves its subsistence in the absolute and extends it into attribute, sublates the very fact that it is attribute; the exposition submerges both the attribute and its distinguishing act in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple absolute.</em></p>

The second of these extremes is the negative as negative, the reflection which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is external&nbsp;</em>to the absolute. Or, in so far as it is taken as the inner of the absolute and it is its own determination to posit itself as mode, then it is the self-externality of the absolute, the loss of itself in the mutability and contingency of being, the accomplished transition of itself into opposites&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without the return into itself</em>; the multiplicity of form and content determinations lacking the character of totality.</p>

But first, in doing so its relationship to these determinations is not merely negative, but this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its act is the reflective movement itsey,&nbsp;</em>and it is only as this that the absolute is truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute identity.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, in this activity the exposition is not dealing merely with something external, nor is mode merely the uttermost externality, but because it is illusory being as illusory being it is the return-into-self, the self-dissolving reflection and it is as this that the absolute is absolute being. Thirdly, the expounding reflection seems to begin from its own determinations and from something external, and to take up the modes and also the determinations of the attribute as simply found outside the absolute; and its act seems to consist in merely tracing these back into an indifferent identity. But in fact it has in the absolute itself the determinateness from which it begins. For the absolute as first indifferent identity is itself only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the determinate absolute&nbsp;</em>or attribute, because it is the unmoved, still unreflected absolute. This<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness,&nbsp;</em>because it is determinateness, belongs to the reflective movement; through this alone is it determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first identity,&nbsp;</em>and equally through this alone does it have absolute form and is not that which merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is</em>&nbsp;equal to itself, but is that which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posits</em>itself as equal to itself.</p>

Spinozism is a defective philosophy because in it reflection and its manifold determining is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external thinking. The</em>substance of this system is one substance, one indivisible totality; there is no determinateness that is not contained and dissolved in this absolute; and it is sufficiently important that in this necessary notion, everything which to natural picture thinking or to the understanding with its fixed distinctions, appears and is vaguely present as something self-subsistent, is completely reduced to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere positedness. Determinateness is negation-is&nbsp;</em>the absolute principle of Spinoza&#39;s philosophy; this true and simple insight establishes the absolute unity of substance. But Spinoza stops short at&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation as determinateness&nbsp;</em>or quality; he does not advance to a cognition of negation as absolute, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-negating, negation; thus his substance does not itself contain the absolute form,</em>&nbsp;and cognition of it is not an immanent cognition. True, substance is the absolute unity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought&nbsp;</em>and being or extension; therefore it contains thought itself, but only in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>with extension, that is, not as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separating&nbsp;</em>itself from extension, hence in general not as a determinative and formative activity, nor as a movement which returns into and begins from itself. Two consequences follow from this: one is that substance lacks the principle of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">personality</em>&nbsp;&mdash; a defect which has been the main cause of hostility to Spinoza&#39;s system; the other is that cognition is external reflection which does not comprehend and derive from substance that which appears as finite, the determinateness of the attribute and the mode, and generally itself as well, but is active as an external understanding, taking up the determinations as given&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and tracing them back&nbsp;</em>to the absolute but not taking its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginnings&nbsp;</em>from the latter.</p>

Apart from the fact that intellect, in accordance with its nature, is postulated as posterior to attribute &mdash; for Spinoza defines it as mode &mdash; attribute, determination as determination of the absolute, is thus made&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dependent on an other,&nbsp;</em>namely, intellect, which appears as external and immediate over against substance.</p>

These two attributes are therefore adopted&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirically.&nbsp;</em>Thought and being represent the absolute in a determination; the absolute itself is their absolute unity and they themselves are only unessential forms; the order of things is the same as that of figurate conceptions or thoughts, and the one absolute is contemplated only by external reflection, by a mode, under these two determinations, once as a totality of conceptions, and again as a totality of things and their mutations. just as it is this external reflection which makes that distinction, so too does it lead the difference back into absolute identity and therein submerges it. But this entire movement proceeds outside the absolute. True, the absolute is itself also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought,&nbsp;</em>and so far this movement is only in the absolute; but as remarked, it is in the absolute only as unity with extension, and therefore not as this movement which is essentially also the moment of opposition. Spinoza makes the sublime demand of thought that it consider everything under the form of eternity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sub specie aeterni,</em>that is, as it is in the absolute. But in the said absolute, which is only unmoved identity, the attribute, like the mode,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing,</em>&nbsp;not as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>so that here, too, the vanishing takes its positive beginning only from without.</p>

Further, this mode remains mere mode; on the one hand it is something immediately given, and on the other, its nullity is not cognised as reflection-into-self. Consequently, the Spinozistic exposition of the absolute is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete&nbsp;</em>in so far as it starts from the absolute, then follows with the attribute, and ends with the mode; but these three are only enumerated&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one after the</em>&nbsp;other, without any inner sequence of development, and the third is not negation as negation, not the negatively self-related negation which would be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>the return into the first identity, so that this identity would then be veritable identity. Hence the necessity of the advance of the absolute to unessentiality is lacking and also the dissolution of the unessentiality in and for itself in the identity; or, there is lacking the becoming both of identity and of its determinations.</p>

The one-sidedness of a philosophical principle is usually countered by its opposite one-sidedness and totality, as in all of them, is usually present as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dispersed completeness-The&nbsp;</em>monad is only one, a negative reflected into itself; it is the totality of the content of the world. In it, the varied multiplicity has not only vanished but is in a negative manner<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preserved;&nbsp;</em>(Spinoza&#39;s substance is the unity of all content; but this manifold content of the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>not as such in it, but in the reflection which is external to it). The monad is therefore essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideative;&nbsp;</em>but although it is finite its nature is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passive,&nbsp;</em>the mutations and determinations in it being manifestations within it of itself. It is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">entelechy,&nbsp;</em>and the manifestation is its own act. The monad is thereby also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate, distinguished from others;&nbsp;</em>the determinateness falls in the particular content and the way and manner of the manifestation. Consequently, the monad is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>or according to its substance, the totality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but it is not so in its manifestation. This limitation&nbsp;</em>of the monad necessarily falls, not in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-positing or ideating&nbsp;</em>monad, but in its in-itself [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ansichsein</em>]; or it is absolute limit, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predestination</em>&nbsp;which s posited by another being than itself. Further, since limited entities exist only as related to other limited entities, yet the monad is at the same time a self-enclosed absolute, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">harmony&nbsp;</em>of these limitations, that is, the relation of the monads to one another, falls outside them and is likewise pre-established by another being or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself.</em></p>

Further, it is necessary to let finitude consist in this, that the content or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance is distinct from the form</em>, and also that the former is limited but the latter infinite. But now we should have to find in the concept of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute monad&nbsp;</em>not only that absolute unity of form and content, but also the nature of reflection as the self-relating negativity which repels itself from itself whereby it posits and creates. True, in Leibniz&#39;s system, the further point is likewise to be found that God is the source of existence and of the essence of the monads, that is to say, that those absolute limitations in the being-in-self or the in-itself of the monads are not limitations in and for themselves, but vanish in the absolute. But in these determinations are to be seen only the usual conceptions which are not philosophically developed, nor raised into speculative Notions. Thus the principle of individuation does not receive its profounder realisation; the concepts concerning the distinction between the various finite monads and their relation to their absolute do not originate out of this being itself, or not in an absolute manner, but are the product of ratiocinative, dogmatic reflection and therefore have not achieved an inner coherence.</p>

This reflection, as sublating itself in its determinations and in general as the self-returning movement, is first truly absolute identity and at the same time is the determining of the absolute or its modality.

But secondly, because it is manifold within itself and has manifold connections with an other, and because variety in its own self passes over into opposition, it is contradictory. If a possibility is in question and its contradiction is to be demonstrated, one need only fasten on to the multiplicity which it contains as content or as its conditioned Existence, and from this its contradiction is easily discovered. But this is not a contradiction arising from comparison; on the contrary, manifold Existence is in its own self this, to sublate itself and to fall to the ground, and for this reason essentially contains within itself the determination of being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely a possible.&nbsp;</em>When all the conditions of something are completely present, it enters into actuality; the completeness of the conditions is the totality as in the content, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the something itself&nbsp;</em>is this content determined as being equally actual as possible. In the sphere of conditioned ground, the conditions have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside them&nbsp;</em>the form &mdash; that is, the ground or the reflection which is for itself &mdash; which connects them into moments of the something in question and which produces Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in them.</em>Here, on the other hand, immediate actuality is not determined by a presupposing reflection to be condition, but it is posited that this actuality itself is possibility.</p>

Therefore, when real possibility sublates itself, this in-itself is also sublated and passes over into actuality. Thus this movement of self-sublating real possibility produces the same moments which are already in being, but now each grows only out of the other; consequently, in this negation it also is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transition,&nbsp;</em>but a going-together-with-itself. Under formal possibility, because something was possible, then-not itself-but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its other&nbsp;</em>was also possible. Real possibility no longer has over against it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">such an other,&nbsp;</em>for it is real in so far as it is itself also actuality. Consequently, when its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate Existence,&nbsp;</em>the circle of conditions, sublates itself, it makes itself into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that in-itself&nbsp;</em>which it already is, namely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>of an other. And since, conversely, its moment of in-itself is thereby at the same time sublated, it becomes actuality, that is, that moment which it likewise already is. Thus what vanishes is this, that actuality was determined as the possibility or in-itself of an other, and conversely, possibility as an actuality which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not that&nbsp;</em>whose possibility it is.</p>

But because being is an illusory being, their relation is also one of identical reflection, of a reflection which is an illusory showing of each in the other.

The immediate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content;&nbsp;</em>its immediacy is at the same time a reflected indifference towards form.

But quality is also a determinateness of reflection; as such it is an indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference.&nbsp;</em>But this energises itself into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition&nbsp;</em>and withdraws into the ground, which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>but also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection-into-self.&nbsp;</em>This sublates itself; but it is itself a reflected in-itself, as such is possibility, and this in-itself is, in its transition which is equally a reflection-into-self, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary actual.</em></p>

They are the simply affirmative something, or the something that is for itself, existing things of manifold properties, or wholes consisting of parts, self-subsistent parts, forces, which require solicitation from one another and have one another for condition. In so far as such an accidental seems to exercise power over another, it is the power of substance which embraces both within itself; as negativity it posits an unequal value, determining the one as a ceasing-to-be and the other with a different content as a coming-to-be, or the former as passing over into its possibility, the latter into actuality &mdash; ever sundering itself into the differences of form and content, and ever purging itself of this one-sidedness, yet in this very purging it has fallen back into determination and disunity. One accident, then, expels another only because its own&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsisting&nbsp;</em>is this totality of form and content itself in which it and its other equally perish.</p>

This can also be considered in the following manner. Illusory being or accidentality is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>indeed substance through power, but it is not thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as this self-identical illusory being; thus substance has only accidentality for its shape or positedness, not itself, it is not substance as substance.

Rain, for example, is the cause of wetness which is its effect; the rain wets &mdash; this is an analytic proposition; the same water which is rain is wetness; as rain, this water is only in the form of a fact by itself; as wetness or moisture, on the other hand, it is adjectival, something posited, that is no longer supposed to have its subsistence in its own self; and the one determination like the other, is external to it. Thus the cause of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this colour&nbsp;</em>is a colouring agent, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pigment,&nbsp;</em>which is one and the same actuality, once in the form of an agent external to it, that is, externally connected with an agent different from it, and again in the determination, equally external to it, of an effect. The cause of an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">act&nbsp;</em>is the inner disposition in an active subject, and this is the same content and worth as the outer existence which it acquires through the deed. If the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>of a body is considered as effect, then its cause is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">propulsive&nbsp;</em>force; but it is the same quantum of motion that is present before and after the impulse, the same existence which the propelling body contained and communicated to the propelled body; and the quantum it communicates is the same as that which it loses itself.</p>

Only this further content is a contingent accessory which does not concern the cause; what other qualities the painter possesses, apart from his being the painter of this picture, this does not enter into this painting; only those of his properties represented in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">effect</em>are present in him&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as cause;&nbsp;</em>he is not cause as regards the rest of his properties.

The change of form suffered by the basic fact in this passage through a number of intermediate terms conceals the identity which it retains in that passage.

But it is clear that the shot, for example, is not by itself this cause, but only the combination of it with other effective determinations.

Thus it is inadmissible to say that food is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of blood, or certain dishes or chill and damp are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">causes&nbsp;</em>of fever, and so on; it is equally inadmissible to assign the ionic climate as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause of</em>&nbsp;Homer&#39;s works, or Caesar&#39;s ambition as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of the downfall of the republican constitution of Rome. In history generally, spiritual masses and individuals are in play and reciprocal determination with one another; but it is rather the nature of spirit, in a much higher sense than it is the character of the living thing in general, not to receive into itself another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original&nbsp;</em>entity, or not to let a cause continue itself into it but to break it off and to transmute it.

The effect which the previously passive substance sublates within itself is, in fact, precisely this effect of the first cause. But the cause has its substantial actuality only in its effect; when this is sublated, its causal substantiality is sublated. This happens first&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself through itself</em>, in that it converts itself into effect; in this identity its negative determination vanishes and it becomes a passive substance; secondly, it happens&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">through the previously passive,&nbsp;</em>but now reactive, substance, which sublates its effect. In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate causality,</em>&nbsp;it is true that the substance which is acted upon also in turn becomes cause, thus acting&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">against&nbsp;</em>the positing in it of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">effect.&nbsp;</em>But it did not react&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">against that cause,&nbsp;</em>but posited its effect again in another substance, giving rise to the progress to infinity of effects; because here the cause is at first only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>identical with itself in its effect, and therefore, on the one hand, vanishes in an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>identity in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rest,&nbsp;</em>and, on the other hand, resuscitates itself in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another</em>substance. In conditioned causality, on the contrary, the cause is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related&nbsp;</em>in the effect, because it is its other as condition, as something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed,&nbsp;</em>and its action is thereby just as much a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>as a positing and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublating of the other.</em></p>
